This project focuses on using artificial intelligence and image recognition technologies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screenings. The Power of AI in Detecting Breast Cancer Early detection and prevention are crucial in the fight against breast cancer, and recent advancements in technology have made it possible for healthcare workers to receive computer assistance in examining mammograms and identifying problematic areas. The integration of machine learning and image recognition technologies in the medical field has the potential to revolutionize breast cancer screening, making it more accurate and efficient. However, the widespread adoption of these artificial intelligence-based solutions will not be possible without good products with great user experience. A user-friendly interface will make it easier for healthcare workers to use these technologies and improve patient outcomes, making it a crucial component in the fight against breast cancer. As a recognized leader in medical research, Semmelweis University has a long-standing reputation for producing cutting-edge advancements in the field. We are proud to have the opportunity to partner with such an esteemed institution and contribute to their ongoing efforts to improve medical outcomes and advance the field of medicine. Implementing AI with a User-Friendly Interface The primary objective of this project was to make the workings of the algorithm more visually accessible to medical professionals. The goal was to design a platform that could be run on any device with network connectivity, either through a standalone application or using Docker technology. This would allow us to demonstrate the algorithm’s capabilities on-site, making it easier for those considering its use to get a hands-on understanding of its capabilities. During the image processing and annotation stage, the application provides real-time feedback in the form of a visual animation and progress bar. This helps users keep track of the analysis as it progresses and gives them a sense of the speed and efficiency of the algorithm. Once all the images have been processed, the application highlights those that show an increased risk, based on the annotations, in an interactive gallery. This gallery provides a clear and easy-to-understand representation of the algorithm’s results, making it a valuable tool for both users and potential adopters. The software is intentionally slowed down for presentation purposes. It’s much, much faster, of course. The Algorithm: Using Faster-RCNN and VGG16 The image detection algorithm at the core of this project uses a state-of-the-art region-based deep convolutional neural network called Faster-R-CNN. This powerful model was specifically designed for object detection and proved to be an effective tool for identifying problematic regions in mammograms. The base network used in the model was VGG16, a highly regarded 16-layer deep convolutional neural network that can be easily obtained from the PyTorch website. To make the algorithm even more effective, we further trained it to detect two different types of objects in mammogram images: benign and malignant lesions. The output of the algorithm is not just a simple diagnosis, but a comprehensive report that includes a score reflecting the confidence level in the diagnosis for each detected lesion. The algorithm also generates a modified image that clearly highlights the locations of the detected lesions by overlaying bounding boxes on the original mammogram. This makes it easy for healthcare workers to understand and interpret the results of the analysis. The Backend – Frontend Integration The backend is responsible for managing the running of the algorithm and ensuring that the results are promptly sent to the frontend once the analysis of an image is completed. The input images are first sent to the frontend, where they are overlaid with a scanline animation, providing a visual indication that the analysis is underway. As soon as the results are available, they are displayed on the frontend as a simple red/green overlay and a small animation before transitioning to the next image. To avoid any potential performance issues, the algorithm is run in serial for all images, as running it in parallel would quickly cause problems when using only the CPU and system memory. However, the CUDA Python SDK provides the ability to automatically use the CPU if a dedicated GPU cannot be found, making it possible to use the algorithm even on basic devices, albeit with reduced efficiency. When a suitable nVidia GPU is available, the algorithm can be run in larger batches, providing much faster results. To get the results back to the frontend, we used Socket.io, as it allows for real-time communication between the backend and frontend, allowing us to directly push data from the backend to the frontend as soon as the algorithm finishes processing an image. The images that have a confidence score below a certain threshold are considered “negative,” indicating that they are likely healthy. These images are presented in a distinctive way, with a small scale-out-scale-in animation. This animation is achieved through the use of CSS animation, utilizing the scale transform function. Deploying the Application with Docker The entire application is packaged in a docker image, making it more accessible and easier to run and distribute. This approach has a number of advantages, one of which is the ability to deploy the application to a cloud service, which opens up the possibility of accessing it from anywhere with an internet connection. However, it is important to consider the architecture of the system you will run the application on, as this can impact which base image you will choose. For example, on M1 Macs, arm64 images are required, and attempting to run other images may result in errors. By utilizing a docker image, the project benefits from the portability and compatibility provided by this technology, allowing for seamless deployment and usage across different platforms. Node, Express and React under the hood In the implementation of this project, we chose to utilize a combination of Node.js and Express for the backend and React for the frontend. This choice was made based on the strengths and capabilities of these technologies, which provided the ideal foundation for the application’s needs. However, it is worth noting that this design may not be the only possible solution, and the application could also be implemented as an Electron app, which is a popular framework for creating desktop applications. This versatility highlights the flexibility of the project and its ability to adapt to different environments and technologies. The key is to find the right tool for the job, and in this case, we found that Node.js, Express, and React provided the optimal solution for our needs.

It's a platform that helps managing containerized workloads and services, and even takes care of scaling. Google open-sourced it in 2014., they handle both the CI and CD parts in one task runner, such as CircleCI or Travis CI. These services offer push-based updates to your deployments, which means that credentials for the code repo and the deployment target must be stored with these services. This method can be problematic if the service gets compromised, e.g. as it happened to CodeShip. Even using services such as GitLab CI and GitHub Actions requires that credentials for accessing your cluster be stored with them. If you’re employing GitOps, to take advantage of using the usual Push to repo -> Review Code -> Merge Code sequence for managing your infrastructure configuration as well, this would also mean access to your whole infrastructure. Learn When to Use Kubernetes: Get Our Case Study! Enter your email to subscribe to our newsletter and we’ll send you a link to download the case study. DOWNLOAD NOW Luckily there are tools to help us with these issues. Two of the most known are Argo CD and Flux. They allow credentials to be stored within your Kubernetes cluster, where you have more control over their security. They also offer pull-based deployment with drift detection. Both of these tools solve the same issues, but tackle them from different angles. Here, we’ll take a deeper look at Argo CD out of the two. What is Argo CD Argo CD is a continuous deployment tool that you can install into your Kubernetes cluster. It can pull the latest code from a git repository and deploy it into the cluster – as opposed to external CD services, deployments are pull-based. You can manage updates for both your application and infrastructure configuration with Argo CD. Advantages of such a setup include being able to use credentials from the cluster itself for deployments, which can be stored in secrets or a vault. Preparation To try out Argo CD, we’ve also prepared a test project that we’ll deploy to Kubernetes hosted on DigitalOcean. You can grab the example project from our GitLab repository here: https://gitlab.com/risingstack-org/argocd-demo/ Forking the repo will allow you to make changes for yourself, and it can be set up later in Argo CD as the deployment source. Get doctl from here: https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/ Or, if you’re using a mac, from Homebrew: brew install doctl You can use any Kubernetes provider for this tutorial. The two requirements are having a Docker repository and a Kubernetes cluster with access to it. For this tutorial, we chose to go with DigitalOcean for the simplicity of its setup, but most other platforms should work just fine. We’ll focus on using the web UI for the majority of the process, but you can also opt to use the `doctl` cli tool if you wish. `doctl` can mostly replace `kubectl` as well. `doctl` will only be needed to push our built docker image to the repo that our deployment will have access to. Helm is a templating engine for Kubernetes. It allows us to define values separately from the structure of the yaml files, which can help with access control and managing multiple environments using the same template. You can grab Helm here: https://github.com/helm/helm/releases Or via Homebrew for mac users: brew install helm Download the latest Argo CD version from https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest If you’re using a mac, you can grab the cli tools from Homebrew: brew install argocd DigitalOcean Setup After logging in, first, create a cluster using the “Create” button on the top right, and selecting Kubernetes. For the purposes of this demo, we can just go with the smallest cluster with no additional nodes. Be sure to choose a data center close to you. Preparing the demo app You can find the demo app in the node-app folder in the repo you forked. Use this folder for the following steps to build and push the docker image to the GitLab registry: docker login registry.gitlab.com docker build . -t registry.gitlab.com/<substiture repo name here>/demo-app-1 docker push registry.gitlab.com/<substiture repo name here>/demo-app-1 GitLab offers a free image registry with every git repo – even free tier ones. You can use these to store your built image, but be aware that the registry inherits the privacy setting of the git repo, you can’t change them separately. Once the image is ready, be sure to update the values.yaml file with the correct image url and use helm to generate the resources.yaml file. You can then deploy everything using kubectl: helm template -f \"./helm/demo-app/values.yaml\" \"./helm/demo-app\" > \"./helm/demo-app/resources/resources.yaml\" kubectl apply -f helm/demo-app/resources/resources.yaml The only purpose of these demo-app resources’ is to showcase the ArgoCD UI capabilities, that’s why it also contains an Ingress resource as a plus. Install Argo CD into the cluster Argo CD provides a yaml file that installs everything you’ll need and it’s available online. The most important thing here is to make sure that you install it into the `argocd` namespace, otherwise, you’ll run into some errors later and Argo CD will not be usable. kubectl create namespace argocd kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml From here, you can use Kubernetes port-forwarding to access the UI of Argo CD: kubectl -n argocd port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:443 This will expose the service on localhost:8080 – we will use the UI to set up the connection to GitLab, but it could also be done via the command line tool. Argo CD setup To log in on the UI, use `admin` as username, and the password retrieved by this command: kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath=\"{.data.password}\" | base64 -d Once you’re logged in, connect your fork of the demo app repo from the Repositories inside the Settings menu on the left side. Here, we can choose between ssh and https authentication – for this demo, we’ll use https, but for ssh, you’d only need to set up a key pair for use. Create an API key on GitLab and use it in place of a password alongside your username to connect the repo. An API key allows for some measure of access control as opposed to using your account password. After successfully connecting the repository, the only thing left is to set up an Application, which will take care of synchronizing the state of our deployment with that described in the GitLab repo. You’ll need to choose a branch or a tag to use to monitor. Let’s choose the master branch for now – it should contain the latest stable code anyway. Setting the sync policy to automatic allows for automatic deployments when the git repo is updated, and also provides automatic pruning and self-healing capabilities. Be sure to set the destination cluster to the one available in the dropdown and use the `demo` namespace. If everything is set correctly, Argo CD should now start syncing the deployment state. Features of Argo CD From the application view, you can now see the different parts that comprise our demo application. Clicking on any of these parts allows for checking the diff of the deployed config, and the one checked into git, as well as the yaml files themselves separately. The diff should be empty for now, but we’ll see it in action once we make some changes or if you disable automatic syncing. You also have access to the logs from the pods here, which can be quite useful – logs are not retained between different pod instances, which means that they are lost on the deletion of a pod, however. It is also possible to handle rollbacks from here, clicking on the “History and Rollback” button. Here, you can see all the different versions that have been deployed to our cluster by commit. You can re-deploy any of them using the … menu on the top right, and selecting “Redeploy” – this feature needs automatic deployment to be turned off. However, you’ll be prompted to do so here. These should cover the most important parts of the UI and what is available in Argo CD. Next up, we’ll take a look at how the deployment update happens when code changes on GitLab. Updating the deployment With the setup done, any changes you make to the configuration that you push to the master branch should be reflected on the deployment shortly after. A very simple way to check out the updating process is to bump up the `replicaCount` in values.yaml to 2 (or more), and run the helm command again to generate the resources.yaml. Then, commit and push to master and monitor the update process on the Argo CD UI. You should see a new event in the demo-app events, with the reason `ScalingReplicaSet`. You can double-check the result using kubectl, where you should now see two instances of the demo-app running: kubectl -n demo get pod There is another branch prepared in the repo, called second-app, which has another app that you can deploy, so you can see some more of the update process and diffs. It is quite similar to how the previous deployment works. First, you’ll need to merge the second-app branch into master – this will allow the changes to be automatically deployed, as we set it up already. Then, from the node-app-2 folder, build and push the docker image. Make sure to have a different version tag for it, so we can use the same repo! docker build . -t registry.gitlab.com/<substitute repo name here>/demo-app-2 docker push registry.gitlab.com/<substitute repo name here>/demo-app-2 You can set deployments to manual for this step, to be able to take a better look at the diff before the actual update happens. You can do this from the sync settings part of `App details`. Generate the updated resources file afterwards, then commit and push it to git to trigger the update in Argo CD: helm template -f \"./helm/demo-app/values.yaml\" \"./helm/demo-app\" > \"./helm/demo-app/resources/resources.yaml\" This should result in a diff appearing `App details` -> `Diff` for you to check out. You can either deploy it manually or just turn auto-deploy back. ArgoCD safeguards you from those resource changes that are drifting from the latest source-controlled version of your code. Let’s try to manually scale up the deployment to 5 instances: Get the name of the replica set: kubectl -n demo get rs Scale it to 5 instances: kubectl -n demo scale --replicas=5 rs/demo-app-<number> If you are quick enough, you can catch the changes applied on the ArgoCD Application Visualization as it tries to add those instances. However, ArgoCD will prevent this change, because it would drift from the source controlled version of the deployment. It also scales the deployment down to the defined value in the latest commit (in my example it was set to 3). The downscale event can be found under the `demo-app` deployment events, as shown below: From here, you can experiment with whatever changes you’d like! Finishing our ArgoCD Kubernetes Tutorial This was our quick introduction to using ArgoCD, which can make your GitOps workflow safer and more convenient.

In this article, we’ll focus on the most popular ones, and explore why they’re either loved or disliked by developers. React React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React apps usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API. React is also used for building reusable UI components. In that sense, it works much like a JavaScript framework such as Angular or Vue. However, React components are typically written in a declarative manner rather than using imperative code, making them easier to read and debug. Because of this, many developers prefer to use React for building UI components even if they are not using it as their entire front-end framework. Advantages: React is fast and efficient because it uses a virtual DOM rather than manipulating the real DOM. React is easy to learn because of its declarative syntax and clear documentation. React components are reusable, making code maintenance easier. Disadvantages: React has a large learning curve because it is a complex JavaScript library. React is not a full-fledged framework, and so it requires the use of additional libraries for many tasks. Next.js Next.js is a javascript library that enables server-side rendering for React applications. This means that next.js can render your React application on the server before sending it to the client. This has several benefits. First, it allows you to pre-render components so that they are already available on the client when the user requests them. Second, it enables better SEO for your React application by allowing crawlers to index your content more easily. Finally, it can improve performance by reducing the amount of work that the client has to do in order to render the page. Here’s why developers like Next.js: Next.js makes it easy to get started with server-side rendering without having to do any configuration. Next.js automatically code splits your application so that each page is only loaded when it is requested, which can improve performance. Disadvantages: If you’re not careful, next.js can make your application codebase more complex and harder to maintain. Some developers find the built-in features of next.js to be opinionated and inflexible. Vue.js Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Unlike other frameworks such as React and Angular, Vue.js is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. The Vue.js library can be used in conjunction with other libraries and frameworks, or can be used as a standalone tool for creating front-end web applications. One of the key features of Vue.js is its two-way data binding, which automatically updates the view when the model changes, and vice versa. This makes it an ideal choice for building dynamic user interfaces. In addition, Vue.js comes with a number of built-in features such as a templating system, a reactivity system, and an event bus. These features make it possible to create sophisticated applications without having to rely on third-party libraries. As a result, Vue.js has become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in recent years. Advantages: Vue.js is easy to learn due to its small size and clear documentation. Vue.js components are reusable, which makes code maintenance easier. Vue.js applications are very fast due to the virtual DOM and async component loading. Disadvantages: While Vue.js is easy to learn, it has a large learning curve if you want to master all its features. Vue.js does not have as many libraries and tools available as some of the other frameworks. Angular Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, html, and Typescript. Angular is created and maintained by Google. Angular provides two-way data binding, so that changes to the model are automatically propagated to the view. It also provides a declarative syntax that makes it easy to build dynamic UIs. Finally, Angular provides a number of useful built-in services, such as HTTP request handling, and support for routing and templates. Advantages: Angular has a large community and many libraries and tools available. Angular is easy to learn due to its well-organized documentation and clear syntax. Disadvantages: While Angular is easy to learn, it has a large learning curve if you want to master all its features. Angular is not as lightweight as some of the other frameworks. Svelte In a nutshell, Svelte is a JavaScript framework similar to React, Vue, or Angular. However, where those frameworks use virtual DOM (Document Object Model) diffing to figure out what changed between views, Svelte uses a technique called DOM diffing. This means that it only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed, making for a more efficient rendering process. In addition, Svelte also includes some built-in optimizations that other frameworks do not, such as automatically batching DOM updates and code-splitting. These features make Svelte a good choice for high-performance applications. Advantages: Svelte has built-in optimizations that other frameworks do not, such as code-splitting. Svelte is easy to learn due to its clear syntax and well-organized documentation. Disadvantages: While Svelte is easy to learn, it has a large learning curve if you want to master all its features. Svelte does not have as many libraries and tools available as some of the other frameworks. Gatsby Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It uses cutting edge technologies to make the process of building websites and applications more efficient. One of its key features is its ability to prefetch resources so that they are available instantaneously when needed. This makes Gatsby websites extremely fast and responsive. Another benefit of using Gatsby is that it allows developers to use GraphQL to query data from any source, making it easy to build complex data-driven applications. In addition, Gatsby comes with a number of plugins that make it even easier to use, including ones for SEO, analytics, and image optimization. All of these factors make Gatsby an extremely popular choice for building modern websites and applications. Advantages: Gatsby websites are extremely fast and responsive due to its use of prefetching. Gatsby makes it easy to build complex data-driven applications due to its support for GraphQL. Gatsby comes with a number of plugins that make it even easier to use. Disadvantages: While Gatsby is easy to use, it has a large learning curve if you want to master all its features. Gatsby does not have as many libraries and tools available as some of the other frameworks. Nuxt.js Nuxt.js is a progressive framework for building JavaScript applications. It is based on Vue.js and comes with a set of tools and libraries that make it easy to create universal applications that can be rendered on server-side and client-side. Nuxt.js also provides a way to handle asynchronous data and routing, which makes it perfect for building highly interactive applications. In addition, Nuxt.js comes with a CLI tool that makes it easy to scaffold new projects and build, run, and test them. With Nuxt.js, you can create impressive JavaScript applications that are fast, reliable, and scalable. Advantages: Nuxt.js is easy to use and extend. Nuxt.js applications are fast and responsive due to server-side rendering. Disadvantages: While Nuxt.js is easy to use, it has a large learning curve if you want to master all its features. Nuxt.js does not have as many libraries and tools available as some of the other frameworks. Ember.js Ember.js is known for its conventions over configuration approach which makes it easier for developers to get started with the framework. It also features built-in libraries for common tasks such as data persistence and routing which makes development faster. Although Ember.js has a steep learning curve, it provides developers with a lot of flexibility and power to create rich web applications. If you’re looking for a front-end JavaScript framework to build SPAs, Ember.js is definitely worth considering. Advantages: Ember.js uses conventions over configuration which makes it easier to get started with the framework. Ember.js has built-in libraries for common tasks such as data persistence and routing. Ember.js provides developers with a lot of flexibility and power to create rich web applications. Disadvantages: Ember.js has a steep learning curve. Ember.js does not have as many libraries and tools available as some of the other frameworks. Backbone.js Backbone.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows developers to create single-page applications. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which means that it separates data and logic from the user interface. This makes code more maintainable and scalable, as well as making it easier to create complex applications. Backbone.js also includes a number of features that make it ideal for developing mobile applications, such as its ability to bind data to HTML elements and its support for touch events. As a result, Backbone.js is a popular choice for developers who want to create fast and responsive applications. Advantages: Backbone.js is lightweight and only a library, not a complete framework. Backbone.js is easy to learn and use. Backbone.js is very extensible with many third-party libraries available. Disadvantages: Backbone.js does not offer as much built-in functionality as some of the other frameworks. Backbone.js has a smaller community than some of the other frameworks. Conclusion In conclusion, while there are many different JavaScript frameworks to choose from, the most popular ones remain relatively stable. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks that developers must weigh when making a decision about which one to use for their project. While no framework is perfect, each has something to offer that can make development easier or faster. Everyone should consider the specific needs of their project when choosing a framework, as well as the skills of their team and the amount of time they have to devote to learning a new framework. By taking all of these factors into account, you can choose the best JavaScript framework for your project! *i*es L*i*es *e.js Consulting DevOps, SRE & Cloud Consul*ent & Code Re* for Software Developers * Building Complex Apps with A*.",

Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure. Ceph storage manages data replication and is generally quite fault-tolerant. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing. Ceph has loads of benefits and great features, but the main drawback is that you have to host and manage it yourself. In this post, we’ll check two different approaches of virtual machine deployment with Ceph. Anatomy of a Ceph cluster Before we dive into the actual deployment process, let’s see what we’ll need to fire up for our own Ceph cluster. There are three services that form the backbone of the cluster ceph monitors (ceph-mon) maintain maps of the cluster state and are also responsible for managing authentication between daemons and clients managers (ceph-mgr) are responsible for keeping track of runtime metrics and the current state of the Ceph cluster object storage daemons (ceph-osd) store data, handle data replication, recovery, rebalancing, and provide some ceph monitoring information. Additionally, we can add further parts to the cluster to support different storage solutions metadata servers (ceph-mds) store metadata on behalf of the Ceph Filesystem rados gateway (ceph-rgw) is an HTTP server for interacting with a Ceph Storage Cluster that provides interfaces compatible with OpenStack Swift and Amazon S3. There are multiple ways of deploying these services. We’ll check two of them: first, using the ceph/deploy tool, then a docker-swarm based vm deployment. Let’s kick it off! Ceph Setup Okay, a disclaimer first. As this is not a production infrastructure, we’ll cut a couple of corners. You should not run multiple different Ceph demons on the same host, but for the sake of simplicity, we’ll only use 3 virtual machines for the whole cluster. In the case of OSDs, you can run multiple of them on the same host, but using the same storage drive for multiple instances is a bad idea as the disk’s I/O speed might limit the OSD daemons’ performance. For this tutorial, I’ve created 4 EC2 machines in AWS: 3 for Ceph itself and 1 admin node. For ceph-deploy to work, the admin node requires passwordless SSH access to the nodes and that SSH user has to have passwordless sudo privileges. In my case, as all machines are in the same subnet on AWS, connectivity between them is not an issue. However, in other cases editing the hosts file might be necessary to ensure proper connection. Depending on where you deploy Ceph security groups, firewall settings or other resources have to be adjusted to open these ports 22 for SSH 6789 for monitors 6800:7300 for OSDs, managers and metadata servers 8080 for dashboard 7480 for rados gateway Without further ado, let’s start deployment. Ceph Storage Deployment Install prerequisites on all machines $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt -y install ntp python For Ceph to work seamlessly, we have to make sure the system clocks are not skewed. The suggested solution is to install ntp on all machines and it will take care of the problem. While we’re at it, let’s install python on all hosts as ceph-deploy depends on it being available on the target machines. Prepare the admin node $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -A ubuntu@13.53.36.123 As all the machines have my public key added to known_hosts thanks to AWS, I can use ssh agent forwarding to access the Ceph machines from the admin node. The first line ensures that my local ssh agent has the proper key in use and the -A flag takes care of forwarding my key. $ wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add - echo deb https://download.ceph.com/debian-nautilus/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt -y install ceph-deploy We’ll use the latest nautilus release in this example. If you want to deploy a different version, just change the debian-nautilus part to your desired release (luminous, mimic, etc.). $ echo \"StrictHostKeyChecking no\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/ssh_config > /dev/null OR $ ssh-keyscan -H 10.0.0.124,10.0.0.216,10.0.0.104 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts Ceph-deploy uses SSH connections to manage the nodes we provide. Each time you SSH to a machine that is not in the list of known_hosts (~/.ssh/known_hosts), you’ll get prompted whether you want to continue connecting or not. This interruption does not mesh well with the deployment process, so we either have to use ssh-keyscan to grab the fingerprint of all the target machines or disable the strict host key checking outright. 10.0.0.124 ip-10-0-0-124.eu-north-1.compute.internal ip-10-0-0-124 10.0.0.216 ip-10-0-0-216.eu-north-1.compute.internal ip-10-0-0-216 10.0.0.104 ip-10-0-0-104.eu-north-1.compute.internal ip-10-0-0-104 Even though the target machines are in the same subnet as our admin and they can access each other, we have to add them to the hosts file (/etc/hosts) for ceph-deploy to work properly. Ceph-deploy creates monitors by the provided hostname, so make sure it matches the actual hostname of the machines otherwise the monitors won’t be able to join the quorum and the deployment fails. Don’t forget to reboot the admin node for the changes to take effect. $ mkdir ceph-deploy $ cd ceph-deploy As a final step of the preparation, let’s create a dedicated folder as ceph-deploy will create multiple config and key files during the process. Deploy resources $ ceph-deploy new ip-10-0-0-124 ip-10-0-0-216 ip-10-0-0-104 The command ceph-deploy new creates the necessary files for the deployment. Pass it the hostnames of the monitor nodes, and it will create cepf.conf and ceph.mon.keyring along with a log file. The ceph-conf should look something like this [global] fsid = 0572e283-306a-49df-a134-4409ac3f11da mon_initial_members = ip-10-0-0-124, ip-10-0-0-216, ip-10-0-0-104 mon_host = 10.0.0.124,10.0.0.216,10.0.0.104 auth_cluster_required = cephx auth_service_required = cephx auth_client_required = cephx It has a unique ID called fsid, the monitor hostnames and addresses and the authentication modes. Ceph provides two authentication modes: none (anyone can access data without authentication) or cephx (key based authentication). The other file, the monitor keyring is another important piece of the puzzle, as all monitors must have identical keyrings in a cluster with multiple monitors. Luckily ceph-deploy takes care of the propagation of the key file during virtual deployments. $ ceph-deploy install --release nautilus ip-10-0-0-124 ip-10-0-0-216 ip-10-0-0-104 As you might have noticed so far, we haven’t installed ceph on the target nodes yet. We could do that one-by-one, but a more convenient way is to let ceph-deploy take care of the task. Don’t forget to specify the release of your choice, otherwise you might run into a mismatch between your admin and targets. $ ceph-deploy mon create-initial Finally, the first piece of the cluster is up and running! create-initial will deploy the monitors specified in ceph.conf we generated previously and also gather various key files. The command will only complete successfully if all the monitors are up and in the quorum. $ ceph-deploy admin ip-10-0-0-124 ip-10-0-0-216 ip-10-0-0-104 Executing ceph-deploy admin will push a Ceph configuration file and the ceph.client.admin.keyring to the /etc/ceph directory of the nodes, so we can use the ceph CLI without having to provide the ceph.client.admin.keyring each time to execute a command. At this point, we can take a peek at our cluster. Let’s SSH into a target machine (we can do it directly from the admin node thanks to agent forwarding) and run sudo ceph status. $ sudo ceph status cluster: id: 0572e283-306a-49df-a134-4409ac3f11da health: HEALTH_OK services: mon: 3 daemons, quorum ip-10-0-0-104,ip-10-0-0-124,ip-10-0-0-216 (age 110m) mgr: no daemons active osd: 0 osds: 0 up, 0 in data: pools: 0 pools, 0 pgs objects: 0 objects, 0 B usage: 0 B used, 0 B / 0 B avail pgs: Here we get a quick overview of what we have so far. Our cluster seems to be healthy and all three monitors are listed under services. Let’s go back to the admin and continue adding pieces. $ ceph-deploy mgr create ip-10-0-0-124 For luminous+ builds a manager daemon is required. It’s responsible for monitoring the state of the Cluster and also manages modules/plugins. Okay, now we have all the management in place, let’s add some storage to the cluster to make it actually useful, shall we? First, we have to find out (on each target machine) the label of the drive we want to use. To fetch the list of available disks on a specific node, run $ ceph-deploy disk list ip-10-0-0-104 Here’s a sample output: $ ceph-deploy osd create --data /dev/nvme1n1 ip-10-0-0-124 $ ceph-deploy osd create --data /dev/nvme1n1 ip-10-0-0-216 $ ceph-deploy osd create --data /dev/nvme1n1 ip-10-0-0-104 In my case the label was nvme1n1 on all 3 machines (courtesy of AWS), so to add OSDs to the cluster I just ran these 3 commands. At this point, our cluster is basically ready. We can run ceph status to see that our monitors, managers and OSDs are up and running. But nobody wants to SSH into a machine every time to check the status of the cluster. Luckily there’s a pretty neat dashboard that comes with Ceph, we just have to enable it. …Or at least that’s what I thought. The dashboard was introduced in luminous release and was further improved in mimic. However, currently we’re deploying nautilus, the latest version of Ceph. After trying the usual way of enabling the dashboard via a manager $ sudo ceph mgr module enable dashboard we get an error message saying Error ENOENT: all mgr daemons do not support module 'dashboard', pass --force to force enablement. Turns out, in nautilus the dashboard package is no longer installed by default. We can check the available modules by running $ sudo ceph mgr module ls and as expected, dashboard is not there, it comes in a form a separate package. So we have to install it first, luckily it’s pretty easy. $ sudo apt install -y ceph-mgr-dashboard Now we can enable it, right? Not so fast. There’s a dependency that has to be installed on all manager hosts, otherwise we get a slightly cryptic error message saying Error EIO: Module 'dashboard' has experienced an error and cannot handle commands: No module named routes. $ sudo apt install -y python-routes We’re all set to enable the dashboard module now. As it’s a public-facing page that requires login, we should set up a cert for SSL. For the sake of simplicity, I’ve just disabled the SSL feature. You should never do this in production, check out the official docs to see how to set up a cert properly. Also, we’ll need to create an admin user so we can log in to our dashboard. $ sudo ceph mgr module enable dashboard $ sudo ceph config set mgr mgr/dashboard/ssl false $ sudo ceph dashboard ac-user-create admin secret administrator By default, the dashboard is available on the host running the manager on port 8080. After logging in, we get an overview of the cluster status, and under the cluster menu, we get really detailed overviews of each running daemon. If we try to navigate to the Filesystems or Object Gateway tabs, we get a notification that we haven’t configured the required resources to access these features. Our cluster can only be used as a block storage right now. We have to deploy a couple of extra things to extend its usability. Quick detour: In case you’re looking for a company that can help you with Ceph, or DevOps in general, feel free to reach out to us at RisingStack! Using the Ceph filesystem Going back to our admin node, running $ ceph-deploy mds create ip-10-0-0-124 ip-10-0-0-216 ip-10-0-0-104 will create metadata servers, that will be inactive for now, as we haven’t enabled the feature yet. First, we need to create two RADOS pools, one for the actual data and one for the metadata. $ sudo ceph osd pool create cephfs_data 8 $ sudo ceph osd pool create cephfs_metadata 8 There are a couple of things to consider when creating pools that we won’t cover here. Please consult the documentation for further details. After creating the required pools, we’re ready to enable the filesystem feature $ sudo ceph fs new cephfs cephfs_metadata cephfs_data The MDS daemons will now be able to enter an active state, and we are ready to mount the filesystem. We have two options to do that, via the kernel driver or as FUSE with ceph-fuse. Before we continue with the mounting, let’s create a user keyring that we can use in both solutions for authorization and authentication as we have cephx enabled. There are multiple restrictions that can be set up when creating a new key specified in the docs. For example: $ sudo ceph auth get-or-create client.user mon 'allow r' mds 'allow r, allow rw path=/home/cephfs' osd 'allow rw pool=cephfs_data' -o /etc/ceph/ceph.client.user.keyring will create a new client key with the name user and output it into ceph.client.user.keyring. It will provide write access for the MDS only to the /home/cephfs directory, and the client will only have write access within the cephfs_data pool. Mounting with the kernel Now let’s create a dedicated directory and then use the key from the previously generated keyring to mount the filesystem with the kernel. $ sudo mkdir /mnt/mycephfs $ sudo mount -t ceph 13.53.114.94:6789:/ /mnt/mycephfs -o name=user,secret=AQBxnDFdS5atIxAAV0rL9klnSxwy6EFpR/EFbg== Attaching with FUSE Mounting the filesystem with FUSE is not much different either. It requires installing the ceph-fuse package. $ sudo apt install -y ceph-fuse Before we run the command we have to retrieve the ceph.conf and ceph.client.user.keyring files from the Ceph host and put the in /etc/ceph. The easiest solution is to use scp. $ sudo scp ubuntu@13.53.114.94:/etc/ceph/ceph.conf /etc/ceph/ceph.conf $ sudo scp ubuntu@13.53.114.94:/etc/ceph/ceph.client.user.keyring /etc/ceph/ceph.keyring Now we are ready to mount the filesystem. $ sudo mkdir cephfs $ sudo ceph-fuse -m 13.53.114.94:6789 cephfs Using the RADOS gateway To enable the S3 management feature of the cluster, we have to add one final piece, the rados gateway. $ ceph-deploy rgw create ip-10-0-0-124 For the dashboard, it’s required to create a radosgw-admin user with the system flag to enable the Object Storage management interface. We also have to provide the user’s access_key and secret_key to the dashboard before we can start using it. $ sudo radosgw-admin user create --uid=rg_wadmin --display-name=rgw_admin --system $ sudo ceph dashboard set-rgw-api-access-key <access_key> $ sudo ceph dashboard set-rgw-api-secret-key <secret_key> Using the Ceph Object Storage is really easy as RGW provides an interface identical to S3. You can use your existing S3 requests and code without any modifications, just have to change the connection string, access, and secret keys. Ceph Storage Monitoring The dashboard we’ve deployed shows a lot of useful information about our cluster, but monitoring is not its strongest suit. Luckily Ceph comes with a Prometheus module. After enabling it by running: $ sudo ceph mgr module enable prometheus A wide variety of metrics will be available on the given host on port 9283 by default. To make use of these exposed data, we’ll have to set up a prometheus instance. I strongly suggest running the following containers on a separate machine from your Ceph cluster. In case you are just experimenting (like me) and don’t want to use a lot of VMs, make sure you have enough memory and CPU left on your virtual machine before firing up docker, as it can lead to strange behaviour and crashes if it runs out of resources. There are multiple ways of firing up Prometheus, probably the most convenient is with docker. After installing docker on your machine, create a prometheus.yml file to provide the endpoint where it can access our Ceph metrics. # /etc/prometheus.yml scrape_configs: - job_name: 'ceph' # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics' # scheme defaults to 'http'. static_configs: - targets: ['13.53.114.94:9283] Then launch the container itself by running: $ sudo docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /etc/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus Prometheus will start scraping our data, and it will show up on its dashboard. We can access it on port 9090 on its host machine. Prometheus dashboard is great but does not provide a very eye-pleasing dashboard. That’s the main reason why it’s usually used in pair with Graphana, which provides awesome visualizations for the data provided by Prometheus. It can be launched with docker as well. $ sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana Grafana is fantastic when it comes to visualizations, but setting up dashboards can be a daunting task. To make our lives easier, we can load one of the pre-prepared dashboards, for example this one. Ceph Deployment: Lessons Learned & Next Up CEPH can be a great alternative to AWS S3 or other object storages when running in the public operating your service in the private cloud is simply not an option. The fact that it provides an S3 compatible interface makes it a lot easier to port other tools that were written with a “cloud first” mentality. It also plays nicely with Prometheus, thus you don’t need to worry about setting up proper monitoring for it, or you can swap it a more simple, more battle-hardened solution such as Nagios. In this article, we deployed CEPH to bare virtual machines, but you might need to integrate it into your KubernetesKubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) offers a framework to run distributed systems efficiently. It's a platform that helps managing containerized workloads and services, and even takes care of scaling. Google open-sourced it in 2014. or Docker Swarm cluster. While it is perfectly fine to install it on VMs next to your container orchestration tool, you might want to leverage the services they provide when you deploy your CEPH cluster. If that is your use case, stay tuned for our next post covering CEPH where we’ll take a look at the black magic required to use CEPH on Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. In the next CEPH tutorial which we’ll release next week, we’re going to take a look at valid ceph storage alternatives with Docker or with Kubernetes.

Despite the fact that the “AI is going to take our jobs” discourse proved to be an effective tool in the clickbait content creators toolbelt, I will not take this road. Instead of contributing to the moral panic about the supposedly inevitable replacement of white collar jobs, or pretending to be offended by a chatbot, I’ll help our readers to consider GPT-based products as tools that could be useful in a professional webdev setting. To do so, I asked some of my colleagues about their experiences of using GPT and various mutations of it – to help you get a more grounded understanding of their utility. In case you have an experience that you consider useful sharing with the RisingStack community, please share it though this form. I’ll drop the results / best ones in the article later on! Daniel’s ‘Code GPT’ vscode plugin review I’ve been pretty satisfied with GitHub Copilot. It does the job well, and it is priced reasonably. Still, after depleting the free tier, I decided to look for an open source alternative. TabNine is an honorable mention here, and a well established player, but based on my previous experience (about two years ago, mind you), it is clunky. Nowhere near the breeze of a dev experience you get from Copilot. But take heart, there is a staggering amount of plugins out there for VS Code, if you look for AI-based coding assistants. At the time of writing this, Code GPT is the winner by number of downloads, and number of (positive) votes, so I decided to give it a go. You can choose from a range of OpenAPI and Cohere models, with GPT-3 being the default. Features: 1, Code Generation from comment prompts The suggestions are relevant, and of quality. The plugin doesn’t offer code completion on the fly, unlike Copilot, but communicates with you in a new IDE pane it opens automatically instead. I like this feature, since I can pick the parts from the suggestion I liked, without bloating the code I’m working on, and having to delete the irrelevant lines. This behavior comes in handy with the other features as well. Let’s see those. 2, Unit Test generation While the results are often far from being complete, it saves me a lot of boilerplate code. It is also handy in reminding me of cases that I otherwise might have forgotten. For this feature to work well, adjust your max token length to a 1000 at least in the Settings, since a comprehensive test suite usually ends up quite verbose, and you’ll only get part of it with a tight quota. 3, Find Problems Your code review buddy. Once I feel I’m done with my work, a quick scan doesn’t take long before committing. While it often is straight out wrong about the ‘issues’ it points out, it doesn’t take long to scan through the suggestions, and catch mistakes before your real life reviewer does. 4, Refactor Save some time for your team lead for extra credits, and run Refactor against your code. Don’t expect miracles to happen, but often times it catches stuff that managed to sneak under your radar. Note: the default max token length won’t cut it here either. 5, Document and Explain Listed as two separate functionality in the documentation, it achieves essentially the same thing; provides a high level natural language description on what the highlighted peace of code does. I tend to use it less often, but it is a nice to have. 6, Ask CodeGPT I left it the last, but this is the most flexible feature of this plugin. It can achieve all previously mentioned functionalities with the right prompt, and more. Convert your .js to .ts, generate a README.md file from code, as suggested in the documentation, or just go ahead and ask for a recipe for a delicious apple pie, like you would from ChatGPT 🥧 My Conclusion: Code GPT offers many functionality that Copilot doesn’t, but lacks the thing Copilot is best at: inline code completion. So if you want to take the most out of AI, just use both, as these two tools complement each other really nice. Code GPT Might come handy if you’re just getting started with a new language or framework. The Explain feature helps double-check your gut feeling, or gives you the missing hint in the right direction. Bump up your max token length to at least a 1000, c’mon, it’s only ¢2 😉 An interesting alternative I might be trying in the future is ‘ChatGPT’ plugin (from either Tim Kmecl or Ali Gencay) that claims to be using the unofficial Chat GPT API, with all its superpowers. Further reading: – official site: https://www.codegpt.co/ – GitHub CoPilot vs ChatGPT: https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/battle-of-the-giants-github-copilot-vs-chatgpt-4oac – List of GitHub CoPilot alternatives: https://www.tabnine.com/blog/github-copilot-alternatives/ Olga on writing Mongo queries with ChatGPT I have used ChatGPT for more effective coding. It was really helpful for example with enhancing Mongo queries for more complex use cases as it suggested specific stages that worked for a use case, which would have definitely taken me more time to research and realize which stage and/or operator is ideal for this query. However all the answers it produces should be checked and not used blindly. I have not yet come across a case when the answer it provided didn’t need modification (though maybe it is due to the fact that I didn’t use it for easy things). I have also noticed that, if a question posted to ChatGPT includes many different parameters, in a lot of cases it will not take them all to consideration so one has to continue conversation and ensure all parameters are considered in the solution. Akos on using ChatGPT instead of StackOverflow I have been using ChatGPT since its inception and have found it to be a valuable tool in my daily work. With ChatGPT, I no longer have to spend hours searching and Googling for regex patterns on Stack Overflow. Instead, I simply write down what I want with the regex, and the tool returns the result, saving me a significant amount of time and effort. In addition to regex, I have also found ChatGPT to be a valuable tool when working on scrapers. Dealing with deeply nested selectors can be a challenge, and understanding how they work with scraping tools can take hours of research. But with ChatGPT, I can simply paste an example HTML and ask the tool to select what I want, saving me even more time and effort. However, it is important to use ChatGPT in moderation. Overusing the tool could lead to a decline in my problem-solving skills and make me too dependent on it. By setting limits, I can still benefit from ChatGPT’s time-saving features while maintaining my critical thinking skills. In conclusion, ChatGPT has been a powerful tool in my work, saving me time and effort in regex and scraping tasks. However, it is important to use it in moderation and not let it compromise my problem-solving skills. Me, Navigating the hallucinations of chatGPT I work with a lot of text: business documents, project proposals, contracts, articles, marketing materials, you name it. I’ve been fascinated by the emergence of “AI” tools in 2022 and both the entertainment factor and the usefulness they can provide. All big areas – text, voice, image – had huge releases that made the internet a very interesting place again after the boring years of the web3 / crypto / nft / metaverse nonsense. Suddenly I felt the rush of discovering the internet in the early 2000’s. “Wow, I can do that?!” was a sentence that got repeated a lot this year. The Dall-E2 / Stable Diffusion / Whisper releases were more than enough to shake up the web, but ChatGPT was the one that really disrupted the web. The first good conversational “AI” that everyone could use, and for free (for now). At times it can be so convincing that people forget that it is just a very good bullshitter. For example when I ask it about RisingStack, I get the following answer: “RisingStack is a software development and consulting company that specializes in building scalable, high-performance systems using Node.js, Kubernetes, and other modern web technologies. The company was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Budapest, Hungary, with additional offices in London, United Kingdom, and New York, United States. RisingStack offers a range of services, including software development, architecture design, cloud infrastructure management, performance optimization, and training. They also develop open-source tools such as Trace, a Node.js performance monitoring and debugging tool, and Pino, a Node.js logging library. RisingStack has worked with a variety of clients, ranging from small startups to large enterprises, across a range of industries, including fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, and media. They are known for their expertise in Node.js and their commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.” Most of this text is usable, but it contains a lot of outright lies. It is important to keep in mind that GPT hallucinates. It has no idea about what is true and what is not. It pretends to know things, but it’s just making things up word by word. In this case: RisingStack was founded in 2014, and we never had a London office. Trace was sunset like 6 years ago, and Pino has nothing to do with us. Anyways, I find it really useful when I need to generate / rephrase / improve text. It is only valid as a Google replacement if you can confidently tell if it’s right or wrong, so “geepeetee-ing” something is not really that helpful right now. I already used it to write contracts, blog posts (not this one though), business proposals. It also brought in new clients, as just in the past couple of weeks we used it to.. Automatically generate product names and descriptions for webshops Create easy-read text for children with disabilities Perform sentiment analysis and write answers automatically to customer reviews Currently chatGPT has a lame writing style by default. It’s very formulaic. I’ve seen so much of it that I believe I can spot it 8 out of 10 times right away. It lies a lot, and I wasn’t able to get anything guitar-related useful out of it, despite the fact that the training material probably has a couple million tabs in it. Anyways, here are my not-so-hot takes to about it: You really need to carefully double check everything you generate. On the surface most of it might look good enough, but that’s just making it easier for everyone to get lazy with it. “AI” won’t replace jobs, instead, it will just improve productivity. As Photoshop is a better brush, GPT should be thought of as a better text/code editor. Most of the office jobs are about collaboration anyways, not typing on a keyboard. Artists won’t get replaced en masse. You won’t be able to prompt an engine to generate artwork in de Goya’s style, if cave paintings are the apex of your visual art knowledge. Taste will be very important to stand out when the web gets flooded with endless mediocre “art”. Also.. It will be interesting to see how the “poisoning the well” problem will affect these models. The continuous retraining of the “AI” on already “AI generated” content will cause a big decline in the quality of these services, in case they won’t be able to filter them out… While they are working on making the generated content so good that it gets mistaken for genuine human creation. It’s a bit scary to think about how Microsoft will dominate this space through its OpenAI investment. Despite the genius branding, it is not open at all, and will cost a lot of money without serious competitors or general access to free-to-use alternatives (like Stable Diffusion for images). Most of the coverage GPT gets nowadays is about people gaming the engine to finally say something “bad”, then pretending to be offended, even more so, scared of it! This kind of AI ethics/alignment discourse is incredibly dull and boring, imho.. Although the adversarial aspect is very interesting. Poisoning generally available chatbots training data will be a prime trolling activity, while convincing chatbots to spill their carefully crafted secret sauce prompts is something that needs to be continuously prevented. I was first skeptical about prompt engineering as an emerging “profession”, but seeing how building products on top of GPT3 requires proper prompting and safeguards to make the end result consistently useful for end users, I can see it happening. Also, when you build something LLM driven, you need to be aware that hostile users, trolls, competitors, etc.. will try to game your product to ramp up your cloud costs or cause reputational harm. This tweet really gets it. This is already happening. Most of the “AI-driven” products are just purpose-repacked custom prompters calling GPT3 through an API, with a fancy UI. Anyways, I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of GPT driven products we’ll make for our clients, and how the internet will change in general. I’m curious about your experience with chatGPT, so please share it with me through this short form!

Still, it is easy to run into the limits imposed by running it on just one machine when trying to make sure that our API will be able to serve hundreds of thousands or even millions of users. We can get around this issue by deploying and running our tests to multiple machines in the cloud. In this article, we will take a look at one way to distribute and run Jmeter tests along multiple droplets on DigitalOcean using Terraform, AnsibleAnsible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It enables Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), meaning that it can handle the state of infrastructure through idempotent changes, defined with an easily readable, domain-specific language instead of relying on Bash scripts., and a little bit of bash scripting to automate the process as much as possible. Background: During the COVID19 outbreak induced lockdowns, we’ve been tasked by a company (who builds an e-learning platform primarily for schools) to build out an infrastructure that is: geo redundant, supports both single and multi tenant deployments , can be easily scaled to serve at least 1.5 million users in huge bursts, and runs on-premises. To make sure the application is able to handle these requirements, we needed to set up the infrastructure, and model a reasonably high burst in requests to get an idea about the load the application and its underlying infrastructure is able to serve. In this article, we’ll share practical advice and some of the scripts we used to automate the load-testing process using Jmeter, Terraform and Ansible. Let’s Start! Have these tools installed before you begin! brew install ansible brew install terraform brew install jmeter You can just run them from your own machine. The full codebase is available on Github at RisingStack/distributed-loadtests-jmeter for your convenience. Why do we use Jmeter for distributed load testing? Jmeter is not my favorite tool for load testing owing mostly to the fact that scripting it is just awkward. But looking at the other tools that support distribution, it seems to be the best free one for now. K6 looks good, but right now it does not support distribution outside the paid, hosted version. Locust is another interesting one, but it’s focusing too much on random test picking, and if that’s not what I’m looking for, it is quite awkward to use as well – just not flexible enough right now. So, back to Jmeter! Terraform is infrastructure as code, which allows us to describe the resources we want to use in our deployment and configure the droplets so we have them ready for running some tests. This will, in turn, be deployed by Ansible to our cloud service provider of choice, DigitalOcean – though with some changes, you can make this work with any other provider, as well as your on-premise machines if you wish so. Deploying the infrastructure There will be two kinds of instances we’ll use: primary, of which we’ll have one coordinating the testing, and runners, that we can have any number of. In the example, we’re going to go with two, but we’ll see that it is easy to change this when needed. You can check the variables.tf file to see what we’ll use. You can use these to customise most aspects of the deployment to fit your needs. This file holds the vars that will be plugged into the other template files – main.tf and provider.tf. The one variable you’ll need to provide to Terraform for the example setup to work is your DigitalOcean api token, that you can export like this from the terminal: export TF_VAR_do_token=DO_TOKEN Should you wish to change the number of test runner instances, you can do so by exporting this other environment variable: export TF_VAR_instance_count=2 You will need to generate two ssh key pairs, one for the root user, and one for a non-privileged user. These will be used by Ansible, which uses ssh to deploy the testing infrastructure as it is agent-less. We will also use the non-privileged user when starting the tests for copying over files and executing commands on the primary node. The keys should be set up with correct permissions, otherwise, you’ll just get an error. Set the permissions to 600 or 700 like this: chmod 600 /path/to/folder/with/keys/* To begin, we should open a terminal in the terraform folder, and call terraform init which will prepare the working directory. Thisl needs to be called again if the configuration changes. You can use terraform plan that will output a summary of what the current changes will look like to the console to double-check if everything is right. At the first run, it will be what the deployment will look like. Next, we call terraform apply which will actually apply the changes according to our configuration, meaning we’ll have our deployment ready when it finishes! It also generates a .tfstate file with all the information about said deployment. If you wish to dismantle the deployment after the tests are done, you can use terraform destroy. You’ll need the .tfstate file for this to work though! Without the state file, you need to delete the created droplets by hand, and also remove the ssh key that has been added to DigitalOcean. Running the Jmeter tests The shell script we are going to use for running the tests is for convenience – it consists of copying the test file to our primary node, cleaning up files from previous runs, running the tests, and then fetching the results. #!/bin/bash set -e # Argument parsing, with options for long and short names for i in \"$@\" do case $i in -o=*|--out-file=*) # i#*= This removes the shortest substring ending with # '=' from the value of variable i - leaving us with just the # value of the argument (i is argument=value) OUTDIR=\"${i#*=}\" shift ;; -f=*|--test-file=*) TESTFILE=\"${i#*=}\" shift ;; -i=*|--identity-file=*) IDENTITYFILE=\"${i#*=}\" shift ;; -p=*|--primary-ip=*) PRIMARY=\"${i#*=}\" shift ;; esac done # Check if we got all the arguments we'll need if [ -z \"$TESTFILE\" ] || [ ! -f \"$TESTFILE\" ]; then echo \"Please provide a test file\" exit 1 fi if [ -z \"$OUTDIR\" ]; then echo \"Please provide a result destination directory\" exit 1 fi if [ -z \"$IDENTITYFILE\" ]; then echo \"Please provide an identity file for ssh access\" exit 1 fi if [ -z \"$PRIMARY\" ]; then PRIMARY=$(terraform output primary_address) fi # Copy the test file to the primary node scp -i \"$IDENTITYFILE\" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no \"$TESTFILE\" \"runner@$PRIMARY:/home/runner/jmeter/test.jmx\" # Remove files from previous runs if any, then run the current test ssh -i \"$IDENTITYFILE\" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no \"runner@$PRIMARY\" << \"EOF\" rm -rf /home/runner/jmeter/result rm -f /home/runner/jmeter/result.log cd jmeter/bin ; ./jmeter -n -r -t ../test.jmx -l ../result.log -e -o ../result -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=$(hostname -I | awk ' {print $1}') EOF # Get the results scp -r -i \"$IDENTITYFILE\" -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no \"runner@$PRIMARY\":/home/runner/jmeter/result \"$OUTDIR\" Running the script will require the path to the non-root ssh key. The call will look something like this: bash run.sh -i=/path/to/non-root/ssh/key -f=/path/to/test/file -o=/path/to/results/dir You can also supply the IP of the primary node using -p= or --primary-ip= in case you don’t have access to the .tfstate file. Otherwise, the script will ask terraform for the IP. Jmeter will then take care of distributing the tests across the runner nodes, and it will aggregate the data when they finish. The only thing we need to keep in mind is that the number of users we set for our test to use will not be split but will be multiplied. As an example, if you set the user count to 100, each runner node will then run the tests with 100 users. And that’s how you can use Terraform and Ansible to run your distributed Jmeter tests on DigitalOcean! Check this page for more on string manipulation in bash. Looking for DevOps & Infra Experts?

He needed a scripting language for web pages that would be easy to use, so he created one himself. He called it JavaScript. And the rest, as they say, is history. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at the history of JavaScript on a timeline. We’ll see how it has evolved over the years and what new features have been added along the way. So sit back and enjoy learning about one of the most popular programming languages in the world! 1994-1998: The Netscape era On December 15, 1994, Netscape Communications Corporation released the Netscape Navigator 1.0 web browser. Brendan Eich created the very first version of JavaScript, codenamed “Mocha”, then later (still internally) renamed to LiveScript “Netscape and Sun announce JavaScript, the open, cross-platform object scripting language for enterprise networks and the internet” Microsoft introduced JScript in Internet Explorer to compete with Netscape. Netscape 2 was released with JavaScript 1.0 Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification. Official release of the first ECMAScript language specification. 1999-2007: The showdown of Internet Explorer VS Mozilla Firefox Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 5, that uses even more proprietary technology than before. ECMAScript 2: Editorial changes to align ECMA-262 with the standard ISO/IEC 16262 ECMAScript 3: do-while, regular expressions, new string methods (concat, match, replace, slice, split with a regular expression, etc.), exception handling, and more Firefox is released to compete with Internet Explorer. Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax. 2008-2012: Netscape died, and Google Chrome was created Netscape Navigator: end of life ECMAScript 4 is officially abandoned. Google releases the Chrome browser, the fastest web browser at the time.

Recently, I’ve been invited to Google DevFest to deliver a presentation on our experiences working with KubernetesKubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) offers a framework to run distributed systems efficiently. It's a platform that helps managing containerized workloads and services, and even takes care of scaling. Google open-sourced it in 2014.. Below I talk about an online learning and streaming platform where the decision to use Kubernetes has been contested both internally and externally since the beginning of its development. The application and its underlying infrastructure were designed to meet the needs of the regulations of several countries: The app should be able to run on-premises, so students’ data could never leave a given country. Also, the app had to be available as a SaaS product as well. It can be deployed as a single-tenant system where a business customer only hosts one instance serving a handful of users, but some schools could have hundreds of users. Or it can be deployed as a multi-tenant system where the client is e.g. a government and needs to serve thousands of schools and millions of users. Learn When to Use Kubernetes: Get Our Case Study!

DOWNLOAD NOW The application itself was developed by multiple, geographically scattered teams, thus a MicroservicesMicroservices are not a tool, rather a way of thinking when building software applications. Let's begin the explanation with the opposite: if you develop a single, self-contained application and keep improving it as a whole, it's usually called a monolith. Over time, it's more and more difficult to maintain and update it without breaking anything, so the development cycle may... architecture was justified, but both the distributed system and the underlying infrastructure seemed to be an overkill when we considered the fact that during the product’s initial entry, most of its customers needed small instances. Was Kubernetes suited for the job, or was it an overkill? Did our client really need Kubernetes? Let’s figure it out. (Feel free to check out the video presentation, or the extended article version below!) Let’s talk a bit about Kubernetes itself! Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration engine that has a vast ecosystem. If you run into any kind of problem, there’s probably a library somewhere on the internet that already solves it. But Kubernetes also has a daunting learning curve, and initially, it’s pretty complex to manage. Cloud ops / infrastructure engineering is a complex and big topic in and of itself. Kubernetes does not really mask away the complexity from you, but plunges you into deep water as it merely gives you a unified control plane to handle all those moving parts that you need to care about in the cloud. So, if you’re just starting out right now, then it’s better to start with small things and not with the whole package straight away! First, deploy a VM in the cloud. Use some PaaS or FaaS solutions to play around with one of your apps. It will help you gradually build up the knowledge you need on the journey. So you want to decide if Kubernetes is for you. First and foremost, Kubernetes is for you if you work with containers! (It kinda speaks for itself for a container orchestration system). But you should also have more than one service or instance. Kubernetes makes sense when you have a huge microservice architecture, or you have dedicated instances per tenant having a lot of tenants as well. Also, your services should be stateless, and your state should be stored in databases outside of the cluster. Another selling point of Kubernetes is the fine gradient control over the network. And, maybe the most common argument for using Kubernetes is that it provides easy scalability. Okay, and now let’s take a look at the flip side of it. Kubernetes is not for you if you don’t need scalability! If your services rely heavily on disks, then you should think twice if you want to move to Kubernetes or not. Basically, one disk can only be attached to a single node, so all the services need to reside on that one node. Therefore you lose node auto-scaling, which is one of the biggest selling points of Kubernetes. For similar reasons, you probably shouldn’t use k8s if you don’t host your infrastructure in the public cloud. When you run your app on-premises, you need to buy the hardware beforehand and you cannot just conjure machines out of thin air. So basically, you also lose node auto-scaling, unless you’re willing to go hybrid cloud and bleed over some of your excess load by spinning up some machines in the public cloud. If you have a monolithic application that serves all your customers and you need some scaling here and there, then cloud service providers can handle it for you with autoscaling groups. There is really no need to bring in Kubernetes for that. Let’s see our Kubernetes case-study! Maybe it’s a little bit more tangible if we talk about an actual use case, where we had to go through the decision making process. Online Learning Platform is an application that you could imagine as if you took your classroom and moved it to the internet. You can have conference calls. You can share files as handouts, you can have a whiteboard, and you can track the progress of your students. This project started during the first wave of the lockdowns around March, so one thing that we needed to keep in mind is that time to market was essential. In other words: we had to do everything very, very quickly! This product targets mostly schools around Europe, but it is now used by corporations as well. So, we’re talking about millions of users from the point we go to the market. The product needed to run on-premise, because one of the main targets were governments. Initially, we were provided with a proposed infrastructure where each school would have its own VM, and all the services and all the databases would reside in those VMs. Handling that many virtual machines, properly handling rollouts to those, and monitoring all of them sounded like a nightmare to begin with. Especially if we consider the fact that we only had a couple of weeks to go live. After studying the requirements and the proposal, it was time to call the client to.. Discuss the proposed infrastructure. So the conversation was something like this: “Hi guys, we would prefer to go with Kubernetes because to handle stuff at that scale, we would need a unified control plane that Kubernetes gives us.” \"Yeah, sure, go for it.\" And we were happy, but we still had a couple of questions: “Could we, by any chance, host it on the public cloud?” \"Well, no, unfortunately. We are negotiating with European local governments and they tend to be squeamish about sending their data to the US. \" Okay, anyways, we can figure something out… “But do the services need filesystem access?” \"Yes, they do.\" Okay, crap! But we still needed to talk to the developers so all was not lost. Let’s call the developers! It turned out that what we were dealing with was an usual microservice-based architecture, which consisted of a lot of services talking over HTTP and messaging queues. Each service had its own database, and most of them stored some files in Minio. In case you don’t know it, Minio is an object storage system that implements the S3 API. Now that we knew the fine-grained architectural layout, we gathered a few more questions: “Okay guys, can we move all the files to Minio?” \"Yeah, sure, easy peasy.\" So, we were happy again, but there was still another problem, so we had to call the hosting providers: “Hi guys, do you provide hosted Kubernetes?” \"Oh well, at this scale, we can manage to do that!\" So, we were happy again, but.. Just to make sure, we wanted to run the numbers! Our target was to be able to run 60 000 schools on the platform in the beginning, so we had to see if our plans lined up with our limitations! We shouldn’t have more than 150 000 total pods! 10 (pod/tenant) times 6000 tenants is 60 000 Pods. We’re good! We shouldn’t have more than 300 000 total containers! It’s one container per pod, so we’re still good. We shouldn’t have more than 100 pods per node and no more than 5 000 nodes. Well, what we have is 60 000 pods over 100 pod per node. That’s already 6 000 nodes, and that’s just the initial rollout, so we’re already over our 5 000 nodes limit. Okay, well… Crap! But, is there a solution to this? Sure, it’s federation! We could federate our Kubernetes clusters.. ..and overcome these limitations. We have worked with federated systems before, so Kubernetes surely provides something for that, riiight? Well yeah, it does… kind of. It’s the stable Federation v1 API, which is sadly deprecated. Then we saw that Kubernetes Federation v2 is on the way! It was still in alpha at the time when we were dealing with this issue, but the GitHub page said it was rapidly moving towards beta release. By taking a look at the releases page we realized that it had been overdue by half a year by then. Since we only had a short period of time to pull this off, we really didn’t want to live that much on the edge. So what could we do? We could federate by hand! But what does that mean? In other words: what could have been gained by using KubeFed? Having a lot of services would have meant that we needed a federated Prometheus and Logging (be it Graylog or ELK) anyway. So the two remaining aspects of the system were rollout / tenant generation, and manual intervention. Manual intervention is tricky. To make it easy, you need a unified control plane where you can eyeball and modify anything. We could have built a custom one that gathers all information from the clusters and proxies all requests to each of them. However, that would have meant a lot of work, which we just did not have the time for. And even if we had the time to do it, we would have needed to conduct a cost/benefit analysis on it. The main factor in the decision if you need a unified control plane for everything is scale, or in other words, the number of different control planes to handle. The original approach would have meant 6000 different planes. That’s just way too much to handle for a small team. But if we could bring it down to 20 or so, that could be bearable. In that case, all we need is an easy mind map that leads from services to their underlying clusters. The actual route would be something like: Service -> Tenant (K8s Namespace) -> Cluster. The Service -> Namespace mapping is provided by Kubernetes, so we needed to figure out the Namespace -> Cluster mapping. This mapping is also necessary to reduce the cognitive overhead and time of digging around when an outage may happen, so it needs to be easy to remember, while having to provide a more or less uniform distribution of tenants across Clusters. The most straightforward way seemed to be to base it on Geography. I’m the most familiar with Poland’s and Hungary’s Geography, so let’s take them as an example. Poland comprises 16 voivodeships, while Hungary comprises 19 counties as main administrative divisions. Each country’s capital stands out in population, so they have enough schools to get a cluster on their own. Thus it only makes sense to create clusters for each division plus the capital. That gives us 17 or 20 clusters. So if we get back to our original 60 000 pods, and 100 pod / tenant limitation, we can see that 2 clusters are enough to host them all, but that leaves us no room for either scaling or later expansions. If we spread them across 17 clusters – in the case of Poland for example – that means we have around 3.500 pods / cluster and 350 nodes, which is still manageable. This could be done in a similar fashion for any European country, but still needs some architecting when setting up the actual infrastructure. And when KubeFed becomes available (and somewhat battle tested) we can easily join these clusters into one single federated cluster. Great, we have solved the problem of control planes for manual intervention. The only thing left was handling rollouts.. As I mentioned before, several developer teams had been working on the services themselves, and each of them already had their own Gitlab repos and CIs. They already built their own Docker images, so we simply needed a place to gather them all, and roll them out to Kubernetes. So we created a GitOps repo where we stored the helm charts and set up a GitLab CI to build the actual releases, then deploy them. From here on, it takes a simple loop over the clusters to update the services when necessary. The other thing we needed to solve was tenant generation. It was easy as well, because we just needed to create a CLI tool which could be set up by providing the school’s name, and its county or state. That’s going to designate its target cluster, and then push it to our Gitops repo, and that basically triggers the same rollout as new versions. We were almost good to go, but there was still one problem: on-premises. Although our hosting providers turned into some kind of public cloud (or something we can think of as public clouds), we were also targeting companies who want to educate their employees. Huge corporations – like a Bank – are just as squeamish about sending their data out to the public internet as governments, if not more.. So we needed to figure out a way to host this on servers within vaults completely separated from the public internet. In this case, we had two main modes of operation. One is when a company just wanted a boxed product and they didn’t really care about scaling it. And the other one was where they expected it to be scaled, but they were prepared to handle this. In the second case, it was kind of a bring your own database scenario, so you could set up the system in a way that we were going to connect to your database. And in the other case, what we could do is to package everything — including databases — in one VM, in one Kubernetes cluster. But! I just wrote above that you probably shouldn’t use disks and shouldn’t have databases within your cluster, right? However, in that case, we already had a working infrastructure. Kubernetes provided us with infrastructure as code already, so it only made sense to use that as a packaging tool as well, and use Kubespray to just spray it to our target servers. It wasn’t a problem to have disks and DBs within our cluster because the target were companies that didn’t want to scale it anyway. So it’s not about scaling. It is mostly about packaging! Previously I told you, that you probably don’t want to do this on-premises, and this is still right! If that’s your main target, then you probably shouldn’t go with Kubernetes. However, as our main target was somewhat of a public cloud, it wouldn’t have made sense to just recreate the whole thing – basically create a new product in a sense – for these kinds of servers. So as it is kind of a spin-off, it made sense here as well as a packaging solution. Basically, I’ve just given you a bullet point list to help you determine whether Kubernetes is for you or not, and then I just tore it apart and threw it into a basket. And the reason for this is – as I also mentioned: Cloud ops is difficult! There aren’t really one-size-fits-all solutions, so basing your decision on checklists you see on the internet is definitely not a good idea. We’ve seen that a lot of times where companies adopt Kubernetes because it seems to fit, but when they actually start working with it, it turns out to be an overkill. If you want to save yourself about a year or two of headache, it’s a lot better to first ask an expert, and just spend a couple of hours or days going through your use cases, discussing those and save yourself that year of headache.

If so, you’ll want to make sure you’re familiar with the questions and answers below at least. This article will help you demonstrate your understanding of Kubernetes concepts and how they can be applied in practice. With enough preparation, you’ll be able to confidently nail your next interview and showcase your Kubernetes skills. Let’s get started! What is Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a platform for managing containerized stateless or stateful applications across a cluster of nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes also automates the replication of the containers across multiple nodes in a cluster, as well as healing of failed containers. Kubernetes was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Some of the key features of Kubernetes include: – Provisioning and managing containers across multiple hosts – Scheduling and deploying containers – Orchestrating containers as part of a larger application – Automated rollouts and rollbacks – Handling container health and failure – Scaling containers up and down as needed – It has a large and active community that develops new features and supports users. – It has a variety of tools for managing storage and networking for containers. What are the main differences between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes? Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are both container orchestration platforms. They are both designed for deploying and managing containers at scale. However, there are some key differences between the two platforms. Docker Swarm is a native clustering solution for Docker. It is simpler to install and configure than Kubernetes. Docker Swarm also uses the same CLI and API as Docker, so it is easy to learn for users who are already familiar with Docker. However, Docker Swarm lacks some of the advanced features that Kubernetes has, such as automatic rollouts and rollbacks, health checks, and secrets management. Kubernetes is a more complex system than Docker Swarm, but it offers a richer feature set. Kubernetes is also portable across different environments, so it can be used in on-premise deployments, as well as cloud-based deployments. In addition, Kubernetes is backed by a large community of users and developers, so there is a wealth of support and documentation available. To sum up: -Kubernetes is more complicated to set up but the benefits are a robust cluster and auto-scaling -Docker Swarm is easy to set up but does not have a robust cluster or autoscaling What is a headless service? ​​A headless service is a special type of Kubernetes service that does not expose a cluster IP address. This means that the service will not provide load balancing to the associated pods. Headless services are useful for applications that require a unique IP per instance or for applications that do not require load balancing. For example, stateful applications such as databases often require a unique IP address per instance. By using a headless service, each instance can be given its own IP address without the need for a load balancer. Headless services can also be used to expose individual instances of an application outside of the Kubernetes cluster. This is often done by using a tool like kubectl to expose individual pods. What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture? Pods and containers are two components of a Kubernetes architecture. Pods are composed of one or more containers that share an IP address and port space. This means that containers within a pod can communicate with each other without going through a network. Pods also provide a way to deploy applications on a cluster in a replicable and scalable way. Containers, on the other hand, are isolated from each other and do not share an IP address. This isolation provides a higher level of security as each container can only be accessed by its own process. In addition, containers have their own file system, which means that they can be used to package up an application so that it can be run in different environments. What are the different management and orchestrator features in Kubernetes? The available management and orchestrator features in Kubernetes are: 1. Cluster management components: These components manage the Kubernetes cluster. 2. Container orchestration components: These components orchestrate the deployment and operation of containers. 3. Scheduling components: These components schedule and manage the deployment of containers on nodes in the cluster. 4. Networking components: These components provide networking capabilities for containers in the cluster. 5. Storage components: These components provide storage for containers in the cluster. 6. Security components: These components provide security for the containers in the cluster. What is the load balancer in Kubernetes? A load balancer is a software program that evenly distributes network traffic across a group of servers. It is used to improve the performance and availability of applications that run on multiple servers. Specifically, the load balancer in Kubernetes is a component that distributes traffic across nodes in a Kubernetes cluster. It can be used to provide high availability and to optimize resource utilization. Also, the load balancer can help to prevent overloads on individual nodes. What is Container resource monitoring? Container resource monitoring means that you can keep track of CPU, Memory, and Disk space utilization for each container in your Kubernetes cluster. There are a two main ways to monitor the Kubernetes cluster. One way is to use the built-in kubectl command-line interface: this is able to monitor CPU utilization, memory usage and disk space. If you need to keep track of more data, then there’s another way: to use a third-party monitoring tool such as Datadog, New Relic, or Prometheus. What is the difference between a ReplicaSet and replication controller? In Kubernetes, a ReplicaSet is a collection of pods that are always up and running. The replication controller’s objectives are to ensure that a desired number of pod replicas are running at all times, and to maintain the desired state of the pods in the system. A ReplicaSet is a newer, more advanced concept that replaces replication controllers. A ReplicaSet allows you to define a minimum number of pods that must be up and running at all times, and provides a richer set of features than replication controllers. ReplicaSets are the basic building blocks of Kubernetes clusters. They provide the ability to have multiple copies of an application running in parallel, and to scale out (add more nodes) or scale in (remove nodes) the number of copies as needed. Replication controllers provide the ability to maintain a desired number of pod replicas for a particular application. A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features. Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or don’t require updates at all. What are the recommended security measures for Kubernetes? There are a number of recommended security measures for Kubernetes, including implementing third-party authentication and authorization tools, using network segmentation to restrict access to sensitive data, and maintaining regular monitoring and auditing of the cluster. Another key recommendation is to use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to the Kubernetes API. This ensures that only authorized users can make changes to the system and introduces an additional layer of protection against potential vulnerabilities or attacks. Node isolation is also worth mentioning. It is a process of isolating individual nodes in a Kubernetes cluster so that each node only has access to its own resources. This process is used to improve the security and performance of Kubernetes clusters by preventing malicious activity on one node from affecting other nodes. Node isolation can be achieved through a variety of means, such as using a firewall to block network traffic between nodes, or using software-defined networking to segment node traffic. By isolating nodes, Kubernetes administrators can ensure that each node in a cluster is used only for its intended purpose and that unauthorized access to resources is prevented. Other best practices for securing Kubernetes include: – Restricting access to the Kubernetes API to authorized users only – Using network firewalls to restrict access to the Kubernetes nodes from unauthorized users – Using intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access to the Kubernetes nodes – Using encryption for communications between the nodes and pods in the cluster – Limiting which IP addresses have access to cluster resources – Implementing regular vulnerability assessments. Ultimately, incorporating these types of security measures into your Kubernetes deployment will help ensure the safety and integrity of your system. What is Container Orchestration and how does it work in Kubernetes? Container orchestration is the process of managing a group of containers as a single entity. Container orchestration systems, like Kubernetes, allow you to deploy and manage containers across a cluster of nodes. This provides a higher-level of abstraction and makes it easier to manage and scale your applications. Kubernetes supports features for container orchestration, including: – Creating and managing containers – Configuring and managing networking – Configuring and managing storage – Booting and managing VMs – Deploying applications – Managing workloads – Accessing logs and monitoring resources – Configuring security and authentication What are the features of Kubernetes? Kubernetes is a platform that enables users to deploy, manage and scale containerized applications. Some of its key features include: -Declarative syntax: Kubernetes uses a declarative syntax that makes it easy to describe the desired state of an application. -Self-healing: Kubernetes is able to automatically heal applications and nodes in the event of failures. -Horizontal scalability: Kubernetes enables users to scale their applications horizontally, by adding or removing nodes as needed. -Fault tolerance: Kubernetes is able to tolerate failures of individual nodes or pods, ensuring that applications are always available. What is Kube-apiserver and what’s the role of it? The Kubernetes apiserver is a critical part of a Kubernetes deployment. The apiserver provides a REST API for managing Kubernetes resources. It also provides authentication and authorization for accessing those resources. The apiserver must be secured to prevent unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources. Use role-based access control to restrict access to specific resources. What is a node in Kubernetes? A node is a master or worker machine in Kubernetes. It can be a physical machine or a virtual machine. A node is a member of a Kubernetes cluster. Each node in a Kubernetes cluster is assigned a unique ID, which is used to identify the node when communicating with the Kubernetes API. When a new node is added to a Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes API is contacted to register the node with the cluster. The Kubernetes API stores information about the node, including its assigned ID, the addresses of the node’s Kubernetes masters, and the labels assigned to the node. When a node is removed from a Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes API is contacted to unregister the node from the cluster. The Kubernetes API removes information about the node from its database, including the node’s assigned ID, the addresses of the node’s Kubernetes masters, and the labels assigned to the node. What is kube-scheduler and what’s the role of it? Kube-scheduler is responsible for keeping track of the state of the cluster and ensuring that all desired pods are scheduled. In a Kubernetes cluster, the scheduler is responsible for assigning Pods to Nodes. When a new Pod is created, the scheduler watches for it and becomes responsible for finding the best Node for that Pod to run on. To do this, the scheduler looks at the requirements of the Pod and compares them with the capabilities of the Nodes in the cluster. The scheduler also takes into account factors such as Node utilization and available resources. By finding the best match between Pods and Nodes, the scheduler helps to ensure that Pods are running on an optimal Node. This, in turn, helps to improve the performance of the overall cluster. To get the most out of the Kubernetes scheduler, you should configure it to schedule your pods as efficiently as possible. You can do this by configuring the scheduler’s resource constraints and pod priorities. What is Minikube? Minikube is important because it allows you to have a local Kubernetes environment. Minikube is a single node Kubernetes environment that you can install on your laptop. This is important because it allows you to develop and test Kubernetes applications without having to deploy them to a cluster. What is a Namespace in Kubernetes? Namespaces are a way to logically group objects in Kubernetes. By default, Kubernetes has a single namespace. Objects in different namespaces can have different security contexts and can be managed independently. How can you handle incoming data from external sources (ingress traffic)? Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that allows an organization to control how external traffic is routed to and from its services. Ingress resources are defined in a YAML file. An Ingress controller is then deployed to manage the ingress resource. Ingress controllers use the Ingress Resource Definition to determine how to route traffic to services. Ingress controllers can use a variety of methods to route traffic, including: -Using a load balancer -Using a DNS server -Using a path-based routing algorithm What are federated clusters? Federated clusters in Kubernetes allow multiple Kubernetes clusters to be interconnected, forming a larger mesh of clusters. This allows for greater scale and redundancy, as well as simplified management of multiple clusters. Federated clusters are configured by setting up a federated control plane, and then adding other Kubernetes clusters to the federated control plane. The federated control plane can be used to manage the other Kubernetes clusters in a number of ways, including: The nodes in the other clusters The Pods in the other clusters The Services in the other clusters The Secrets in the other clusters The ConfigMaps in the other clusters The Deployments in the other clusters The ReplicationControllers in the other clusters The Ingresses in the other clusters The LoadBalancers in the other clusters What is a Kubelet? Kubelet is a daemon on each node that runs on each Kubernetes node. Kubelet is responsible for communicating with the API server to get information about the state of the nodes and pods in the cluster, and for pulling and pushing images to and from the nodes. What is Kubectl? Kubectl is a command-line interface for Kubernetes. With Kubectl, you can manage your Kubernetes clusters and applications. Kubectl can be used on your local machine, or you can use it with a Kubernetes cluster. kubectl can be used to create, delete, and manage Kubernetes objects. What is Kube-proxy? Kube-proxy is a daemon that runs on each Kubernetes node. It is responsible for proxying pod IPs and service IPs to the correct pods and services. Kube-proxy is started automatically by Kubernetes. Kubernetes also uses kube-proxy to load balance services. What are “K8s”? k8s is an abbreviation for Kubernetes. How are Kubernetes and Docker related? Kubernetes is a platform for managing containers at scale, while Docker itself is a container technology that can be used by Kubernetes. A container infrastructure, such as Docker, allows apps to be packaged into lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units. Kubernetes is a platform for managing and orchestrating containers at scale. Along with Kubernetes, Docker gives you the ability to deploy and manage applications at large scales.

Last updated: February 17, 2023 *e.js Consulting De*ting 24.7 Node.js Support Infrastructu*i*es Learn more at risingstack.com * In this article: Tamas Kadlecsik In this article, you will learn how you can simplify your callback or Promise based Node.jsNode.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime and is the most effective when building scalable network applications. Node.js is free of locks, so there's no chance to dead-lock any process. application with asyncAsynchrony, in software programming, refers to events that occur outside of the primary program flow and methods for dealing with them. External events such as signals or activities prompted by a program that occur at the same time as program execution without causing the program to block and wait for results are examples of this category. Asynchronous input/output is an... functions (async awaitIn an async function, you can await any Promise or catch its rejection cause. In ECMAScript 2017, the async and await keywords were introduced. These features make writing asynchronous code easier and more readable in the long run. They aid in the transition from asynchronicity to synchronism by making it appear more like classic synchronous code, so they're well worth learning.). Whether you’ve looked at async/await and promises in JavaScript before, but haven’t quite mastered them yet, or just need a refresher, this article aims to help you. What are async functions in Node.js? Async functions are available natively in Node and are denoted by the async keyword in their declaration. They always return a promise, even if you don’t explicitly write them to do so. Also, the await keyword is only available inside async functions at the moment – it cannot be used in the global scope. In an async function, you can await any Promise or catch its rejection cause. So if you had some logic implemented with promises: function handler (req, res) { return request('https://user-handler-service') .catch((err) => { logger.error('Http error', err); error.logged = true; throw err; }) .then((response) => Mongo.findOne({ user: response.body.user })) .catch((err) => { !error.logged && logger.error('Mongo error', err); error.logged = true; throw err; }) .then((document) => executeLogic(req, res, document)) .catch((err) => { !error.logged && console.error(err); res.status(500).send(); }); } You can make it look like synchronous code using async/await: async function handler (req, res) { let response; try { response = await request('https://user-handler-service') ; } catch (err) { logger.error('Http error', err); return res.status(500).send(); } let document; try { document = await Mongo.findOne({ user: response.body.user }); } catch (err) { logger.error('Mongo error', err); return res.status(500).send(); } executeLogic(document, req, res); } Currently in Node you get a warning about unhandled promise rejections, so you don’t necessarily need to bother with creating a listener. However, it is recommended to crash your app in this case as when you don’t handle an error, your app is in an unknown state. This can be done either by using the --unhandled-rejections=strict CLI flag, or by implementing something like this: process.on('unhandledRejection', (err) => { console.error(err); process.exit(1); }) Automatic process exit will be added in a future Node release – preparing your code ahead of time for this is not a lot of effort, but will mean that you don’t have to worry about it when you next wish to update versions. Patterns with async functions in JavaScript There are quite a couple of use cases when the ability to handle asynchronous operations as if they were synchronous comes very handy, as solving them with Promises or callbacks requires the use of complex patterns. Since node@10.0.0, there is support for async iterators and the related for-await-of loop. These come in handy when the actual values we iterate over, and the end state of the iteration, are not known by the time the iterator method returns – mostly when working with streams. Aside from streams, there are not a lot of constructs that have the async iterator implemented natively, so we’ll cover them in another post. Retry with exponential backoff Implementing retry logic was pretty clumsy with Promises: function request(url) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { reject(`Network error when trying to reach ${url}`); }, 500); }); } function requestWithRetry(url, retryCount, currentTries = 1) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { if (currentTries <= retryCount) { const timeout = (Math.pow(2, currentTries) - 1) * 100; request(url) .then(resolve) .catch((error) => { setTimeout(() => { console.log('Error: ', error); console.log(`Waiting ${timeout} ms`); requestWithRetry(url, retryCount, currentTries + 1); }, timeout); }); } else { console.log('No retries left, giving up.'); reject('No retries left, giving up.'); } }); } requestWithRetry('http://localhost:3000') .then((res) => { console.log(res) }) .catch(err => { console.error(err) }); This would get the job done, but we can rewrite it with async/await and make it a lot more simple. function wait (timeout) { return new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve() }, timeout); }); } async function requestWithRetry (url) { const MAX_RETRIES = 10; for (let i = 0; i <= MAX_RETRIES; i++) { try { return await request(url); } catch (err) { const timeout = Math.pow(2, i); console.log('Waiting', timeout, 'ms'); await wait(timeout); console.log('Retrying', err.message, i); } } } A lot more pleasing to the eye isn’t it? Intermediate values Not as hideous as the previous example, but if you have a case where 3 asynchronous functions depend on each other the following way, then you have to choose from several ugly solutions. functionA returns a Promise, then functionB needs that value and functionC needs the resolved value of both functionA‘s and functionB‘s Promise. Solution 1: The .then Christmas tree function executeAsyncTask () { return functionA() .then((valueA) => { return functionB(valueA) .then((valueB) => { return functionC(valueA, valueB) }) }) } With this solution, we get valueA from the surrounding closure of the 3rd then and valueB as the value the previous Promise resolves to. We cannot flatten out the Christmas tree as we would lose the closure and valueA would be unavailable for functionC. Solution 2: Moving to a higher scope function executeAsyncTask () { let valueA return functionA() .then((v) => { valueA = v return functionB(valueA) }) .then((valueB) => { return functionC(valueA, valueB) }) } In the Christmas tree, we used a higher scope to make valueA available as well. This case works similarly, but now we created the variable valueA outside the scope of the .then-s, so we can assign the value of the first resolved Promise to it. This one definitely works, flattens the .then chain and is semantically correct. However, it also opens up ways for new bugs in case the variable name valueA is used elsewhere in the function. We also need to use two names — valueA and v — for the same value. Are you looking for help with enterprise-grade Node.js Development? Hire the Node developers of RisingStack! Solution 3: The unnecessary array function executeAsyncTask () { return functionA() .then(valueA => { return Promise.all([valueA, functionB(valueA)]) }) .then(([valueA, valueB]) => { return functionC(valueA, valueB) }) } There is no other reason for valueA to be passed on in an array together with the Promise functionB then to be able to flatten the tree. They might be of completely different types, so there is a high probability of them not belonging to an array at all. Solution 4: Write a helper function const converge = (...promises) => (...args) => { let [head, ...tail] = promises if (tail.length) { return head(...args) .then((value) => converge(...tail)(...args.concat([value]))) } else { return head(...args) } } functionA(2) .then((valueA) => converge(functionB, functionC)(valueA)) You can, of course, write a helper function to hide away the context juggling, but it is quite difficult to read, and may not be straightforward to understand for those who are not well versed in functional magic. By using async/await our problems are magically gone: async function executeAsyncTask () { const valueA = await functionA(); const valueB = await functionB(valueA); return function3(valueA, valueB); } Multiple parallel requests with async/await This is similar to the previous one. In case you want to execute several asynchronous tasks at once and then use their values at different places, you can do it easily with async/await: async function executeParallelAsyncTasks () { const [ valueA, valueB, valueC ] = await Promise.all([ functionA(), functionB(), functionC() ]); doSomethingWith(valueA); doSomethingElseWith(valueB); doAnotherThingWith(valueC); } As we’ve seen in the previous example, we would either need to move these values into a higher scope or create a non-semantic array to pass these values on. Array iteration methods You can use map, filter and reduce with async functions, although they behave pretty unintuitively. Try guessing what the following scripts will print to the console: map function asyncThing (value) { return new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => resolve(value), 100); }); } async function main () { return [1,2,3,4].map(async (value) => { const v = await asyncThing(value); return v * 2; }); } main() .then(v => console.log(v)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); filter function asyncThing (value) { return new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => resolve(value), 100); }); } async function main () { return [1,2,3,4].filter(async (value) => { const v = await asyncThing(value); return v % 2 === 0; }); } main() .then(v => console.log(v)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); reduce function asyncThing (value) { return new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => resolve(value), 100); }); } async function main () { return [1,2,3,4].reduce(async (acc, value) => { return await acc + await asyncThing(value); }, Promise.resolve(0)); } main() .then(v => console.log(v)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); Solutions: [ Promise { <pending> }, Promise { <pending> }, Promise { <pending> }, Promise { <pending> } ] [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] 10 If you log the returned values of the iteratee with map you will see the array we expect: [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]. The only problem is that each value is wrapped in a Promise by the AsyncFunction. So if you want to get your values, you’ll need to unwrap them by passing the returned array to a Promise.all: main() .then(v => Promise.all(v)) .then(v => console.log(v)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); Originally, you would first wait for all your promises to resolve and then map over the values: function main () { return Promise.all([1,2,3,4].map((value) => asyncThing(value))); } main() .then(values => values.map((value) => value * 2)) .then(v => console.log(v)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); This seems a bit more simple, doesn’t it? The async/await version can still be useful if you have some long running synchronous logic in your iteratee and another long-running async task. This way you can start calculating as soon as you have the first value – you don’t have to wait for all the Promises to be resolved to run your computations. Even though the results will still be wrapped in Promises, those are resolved a lot faster then if you did it the sequential way. What about filter? Something is clearly wrong… Well, you guessed it: even though the returned values are [ false, true, false, true ], they will be wrapped in promises, which are truthy, so you’ll get back all the values from the original array. Unfortunately, all you can do to fix this is to resolve all the values and then filter them. Reducing is pretty straightforward. Bear in mind though that you need to wrap the initial value into Promise.resolve, as the returned accumulator will be wrapped as well and has to be await-ed. .. As it is pretty clearly intended to be used for imperative code styles. To make your .then chains more “pure” looking, you can use Ramda’s pipeP and composeP functions. Rewriting callback-based Node.js applications Async functions return a Promise by default, so you can rewrite any callback based function to use Promises, then await their resolution. You can use the util.promisify function in Node.js to turn callback-based functions to return a Promise-based ones. Rewriting Promise-based applications Simple .then chains can be upgraded in a pretty straightforward way, so you can move to using async/await right away. function asyncTask () { return functionA() .then((valueA) => functionB(valueA)) .then((valueB) => functionC(valueB)) .then((valueC) => functionD(valueC)) .catch((err) => logger.error(err)) } will turn into async function asyncTask () { try { const valueA = await functionA(); const valueB = await functionB(valueA); const valueC = await functionC(valueB); return await functionD(valueC); } catch (err) { logger.error(err); } } Rewriting Node.js apps with async await If you liked the good old concepts of if-else conditionals and for/while loops, if you believe that a try-catch block is the way errors are meant to be handled, you will have a great time rewriting your services using async/await. As we have seen, it can make several patterns a lot easier to code and read, so it is definitely more suitable in several cases than Promise.then() chains. However, if you are caught up in the functional programming craze of the past years, you might wanna pass on this language feature. Are you already using async/await in production, or you plan on never touching it? Let’s discuss it in the comments below. Are you looking for help with enterprise-grade Node.js Development?

Distributed Tracing API Gateways Asynchronous programming in Node.js Previously we have gathered a strong knowledge about asynchronous programming in JavaScript and understood how the Node.js event loop works. If you have not read these articles, I highly recommend them as introductions! The Problem with Node.js Async Node.js itself is single-threaded, but some tasks can run in parallel thanks to its asynchronous nature. But what does running in parallel mean in practice? Since we program a single-threaded VM, it is essential that we do not block execution by waiting for I/O, but handle operations concurrently with the help of Node.js’s event-driven APIs. Let’s take a look at some fundamental patterns, and learn how we can write resource-efficient, non-blocking code, with the built-in solutions of Node.js. The Classical Approach – Callbacks Let’s take a look at these simple async operations. They do nothing special, just fire a timer and call a function once the timer finished. function fastFunction (done) { setTimeout(function () { done() }, 100) } function slowFunction (done) { setTimeout(function () { done() }, 300) } Seems easy, right? Our higher-order functions can be executed sequentially or in parallel with the basic “pattern” by nesting callbacks – but using this method can lead to an untameable callback-hell. function runSequentially (callback) { fastFunction((err, data) => { if (err) return callback(err) console.log(data) // results of a slowFunction((err, data) => { if (err) return callback(err) console.log(data) // results of b // here you can continue running more tasks }) }) } Never use the nested callback approach for handling asynchronous Node,js operations! Avoiding Callback Hell with Control Flow Managers To become an efficient Node.js developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows. Let me show you some of the tools we can use to organize our code in a nice and maintainable way! #1: Using Promises There have been native promises in javascript since 2014, receiving an important boost in performance in Node.js 8. We will make use of them in our functions to make them non-blocking – without the traditional callbacks. The following example will call the modified version of both our previous functions in such a manner: function fastFunction () { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(function () { console.log('Fast function done') resolve() }, 100) }) } function slowFunction () { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(function () { console.log('Slow function done') resolve() }, 300) }) } function asyncRunner () { return Promise.all([slowFunction(), fastFunction()]) } Please note that Promise.all will fail as soon as any of the promises inside it fails. The previous functions have been modified slightly to return promises. Our new function, asyncRunner, will also return a promise, that will resolve when all the contained functions resolve, and this also means that wherever we call our asyncRunner, we’ll be able to use the .then and .catch methods to deal with the possible outcomes: asyncRunner() .then(([ slowResult, fastResult ]) => { console.log('All operations resolved successfully') }) .catch((error) => { console.error('There has been an error:', error) }) Since node@12.9.0, there is a method called promise.allSettled, that we can use to get the result of all the passed in promises regardless of rejections. Much like Promise.all, this function expects an array of promises, and returns an array of objects that has a status of “fulfilled” or “rejected”, and either the resolved value or the error that occurred. function failingFunction() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { reject(new Error('This operation will surely fail!')) }) } function asyncMixedRunner () { return Promise.allSettled([slowFunction(), failingFunction()]) } asyncMixedRunner() .then(([slowResult, failedResult]) => { console.log(slowResult, failedResult) }) In previous node versions, where .allSettled is not available, we can implement our own version in just a few lines: function homebrewAllSettled(promises) { return Promise.all(promises.map((promise) => { return promise .then((value) => { return { status: 'fulfilled', value } }) .catch((error) => { return { status: 'rejected', error } }) })) } Serial task execution To make sure your tasks run in a specific order – maybe successive functions need the return value of previous ones, or depend on the run of previous functions less directly – which is basically the same as _.flow for functions that return a Promise. As long as it’s missing from everyone’s favorite utility library, you can easily create a chain from an array of your async functions: function serial(asyncFunctions) { return asyncFunctions.reduce(function(functionChain, nextFunction) { return functionChain.then( (previousResult) => nextFunction(previousResult) ); }, Promise.resolve()); } serial([parameterValidation, dbQuery, serviceCall ]) .then((result) => console.log(`Operation result: ${result}`)) .catch((error) => console.log(`There has been an error: ${error}`)) In case of a failure, this will skip all the remaining promises, and go straight to the error handling branch. You can tweak it some more in case you need the result of all of the promises regardless if they resolved or rejected. function serial(asyncFunctions) { return asyncFunctions.map(function(functionChain, nextFunction) { return functionChain .then((previousResult) => nextFunction(previousResult)) .then(result => ({ status: 'fulfilled', result })) .catch(error => ({ status: 'rejected', error })); }, Promise.resolve()); } Converting callback functions to promises Node also provides a handy utility function called “promisify”, that you can use to convert any old function expecting a callback that you just have to use into one that returns a promise. All you need to do is import it in your project: const promisify = require('util').promisify; function slowCallbackFunction (done) { setTimeout(function () { done() }, 300) } const slowPromise = promisify(slowCallbackFunction); slowPromise() .then(() => { console.log('Slow function resolved') }) .catch((error) => { console.error('There has been an error:', error) }) It’s actually not that hard to implement a promisify function of our own, to learn more about how it works. We can even handle additional arguments that our wrapped functions might need! function homebrewPromisify(originalFunction, originalArgs = []) { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { originalFunction(...originalArgs, (error, result) => { if (error) return reject(error) return resolve(result) }) }) } We just wrap the original callback-based function in a promise, and then reject or resolve based on the result of the operation. Easy as that! For better support of callback based code – legacy code, ~50% of the npm modules – Node also includes a callbackify function, essentially the opposite of promisify, which takes an async function that returns a promise, and returns a function that expects a callback as its single argument. const callbackify = require('util').callbackify const callbackSlow = callbackify(slowFunction) callbackSlow((error, result) => { if (error) return console.log('Callback function received an error') return console.log('Callback resolved without errors') }) #2: Meet Async – aka how to write async code in 2020 We can use another javascript feature since node@7.6 to achieve the same thing: the async and awaitIn an async function, you can await any Promise or catch its rejection cause. In ECMAScript 2017, the async and await keywords were introduced. These features make writing asynchronous code easier and more readable in the long run. They aid in the transition from asynchronicity to synchronism by making it appear more like classic synchronous code, so they're well worth learning. keywords. They allow you to structure your code in a way that is almost synchronous looking, saving us the .then chaining as well as callbacks: const promisify = require('util').promisify; async function asyncRunner () { try { const slowResult = await promisify(slowFunction)() const fastResult = await promisify(fastFunction)() console.log('all done') return [ slowResult, fastResult ] } catch (error) { console.error(error) } } This is the same async runner we’ve created before, but it does not require us to wrap our code in .then calls to gain access to the results. For handling errors, we have the option to use try & catch blocks, as presented above, or use the same .catch calls that we’ve seen previously with promises. This is possible because async-await is an abstraction on top of promises – async functions always return a promise, even if you don’t explicitly declare them to do so. The await keyword can only be used inside functions that have the async tag. This also means that we cannot currently utilize it in the global scope. Since Node 10, we also have access to the promise.finally method, which allows us to run code regardless of whether the promise resolve or rejected. It can be used to run tasks that we had to call in both the .then and .catch paths previously, saving us some code duplication. Using all of this in Practice As we have just learned several tools and tricks to handle async, it is time to do some practice with fundamental control flows to make our code more efficient and clean. Let’s take an example and write a route handler for our web app, where the request can be resolved after 3 steps: validateParams, dbQuery and serviceCall. If you’d like to write them without any helper, you’d most probably end up with something like this. Not so nice, right? // validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are higher-order functions // DONT function handler (done) { validateParams((err) => { if (err) return done(err) dbQuery((err, dbResults) => { if (err) return done(err) serviceCall((err, serviceResults) => { done(err, { dbResults, serviceResults }) }) }) }) } Instead of the callback-hell, we can use promises to refactor our code, as we have already learned: // validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are higher-order functions function handler () { return validateParams() .then(dbQuery) .then(serviceCall) .then((result) => { console.log(result) return result }) .catch(console.log.bind(console)) } Let’s take it a step further! Rewrite it to use the async and await keywords: // validateParams, dbQuery, serviceCall are thunks async function handler () { try { await validateParams() const dbResults = await dbQuery() const serviceResults = await serviceCall() return { dbResults, serviceResults } } catch (error) { console.log(error) } } It feels like a “synchronous” code but still doing async operations one after each other. Essentially, a new callback is injected into the functions, and this is how async knows when a function is finished. Takeaway rules for Node.js & Async Fortunately, Node.js eliminates the complexities of writing thread-safe code. You just have to stick to these rules to keep things smooth: As a rule of thumb, prefer async, because using a non-blocking approach gives superior performance over the synchronous scenario, and the async – await keywords gives you more flexibility in structuring your code. Luckily, most libraries now have promise based APIs, so compatibility is rarely an issue, and can be solved with util.promisify should the need arise.

You can find our highlights from the release notes. Built-in WebSocket client A browser-compatible WebSocket implementation has been added to Node.js with this new release as an experimental feature. You can give it a go using the --experimental-websocket flag. The current implementation allows for opening and closing of websocket connections and sending data. There are four events available for use: open, close, message and error – so the basics are covered. It’s pretty exciting to see an out-of-the-box websocket implementation coming to Node, it could spare us the inclusion of yet another library in projects that need bidirectional communication. Be sure to give it a go and give your feedback to the developers! A flush option for the writeFile type filesystem functions Up until now, it was possible for data to not be flushed immediately to permanent storage when a write operation completed successfully, allowing read operations to get stale data. In response, a flush option has been added to the fs module file writing functions that, when enabled, forces data to be flushed at the end of a successful write operation using sync. This feature is not enabled by default, so make sure to include { flush: true } in the options if you’d like to use it. Here is the list of functions the flush option has been added to: filehandle.createWriteStream fsPromises.writeFile fs.createWriteStream fs.writeFile fs.writeFileSync Addition of a global navigator Object This new release also introduces a global navigator object to take steps towards enhancing web interoperability. We can now access hardware concurrency information through navigator.hardwareConcurrency, the only currently implemented method on the object. While this might not seem like a huge change for now, we can assume more and more functionality will be implemented with time, until we have the whole suit of information window.navigator provides in browser environments. This would spare us having to decide between using process and navigator in our code that is to be ran in both a browser and in Node.js. Array grouping There is a new static method added to Object and Map, groupBy(), that groups the items of a given iterable according to a provided callback function. The object returned contains a property for each group, whose value is an array with the items that belong to the group. In case of Object, the keys of the returned object will be strings, while the version on Map can have any kind of key. Additional changes Both the fetch and the webstreams modules are now marked as stable after receiving a few changes with this version. A host of performance improvements as usual with any new release. WebAssembly gets extended const expressions Another new experimental flag, --experimental-default-type, has been added that allows setting the default module type to ESM The globalPreload hook has been removed, it’s functionality replaced by register and initialize Glob patterns are now supported in the test runner Don’t forget that Node.js 16 is at its end of life, so if you’re still using this version, you should plan to upgrade soon to one of the newer LTS versions as soon as possible! The currently active LTS releases are 18 and 20, with version 22 – that is also an LTS version – scheduled to release in April 2024.

I’ve been waiting for a worthy Rails replacement in JavaScript since who-knows-when. This article is an overview of the two, and while I’ve given more breadth to Redwood (as it differs from Rails a great deal), I personally prefer Blitz. As the post ended up being quite lengthy, below, we provide a comparison table for the hasty ones. A bit of history first If you started working as a web developer in the 2010s, you might not have even heard of Ruby on Rails, even though it gave us apps like Twitter, GitHub, Urban Dictionary, Airbnb, and Shopify. Compared to the web frameworks of its time, it was a breeze to work with. Rails broke the mold of web technologies by being a highly opinionated MVC tool, emphasizing the use of well-known patterns such as convention over configuration and DRY, with the addition of a powerful CLI that created end-to-end scaffolds from model to the template to be rendered. Many other frameworks have built on its ideas, such as Django for Python, Laravel for PHP, or Sails for Node.js. Thus, arguably, it is a piece of technology just as influential as the LAMP stack before its time. However, the fame of Ruby on Rails has faded quite a bit since its creation in 2004. By the time I started working with Node.js in 2012, the glory days of Rails were over. Twitter — built on Rails — was infamous for frequently showcasing its fail whale between 2007 and 2009. Much of it was attributed to the lack of Rails’ scalability, at least according to word of mouth in my filter bubble. This Rails bashing was further reinforced when Twitter switched to Scala, even though they did not completely ditch Ruby then. The scalability issues of Rails (and Django, for that matter) getting louder press coverage coincided with the transformation of the Web too. More and more JavaScript ran in the browser. Webpages became highly interactive WebApps, then SPAs. Angular.js revolutionized that too when it came out in 2010. Instead of the server rendering the whole webpage by combining the template and the data, we wanted to consume APIs and handle the state changes by client-side DOM updates. Thus, full-stack frameworks fell out of favor. Development got separated between writing back-end APIs and front-end apps. And these apps could have meant Android and iOS apps too by that time, so it all made sense to ditch the server-side rendered HTML strings and send over the data in a way that all our clients could work with. UX patterns developed as well. It wasn’t enough anymore to validate the data on the back-end, as users need quick feedback while they’re filling out bigger and bigger forms. Thus, our life got more and more complicated: we needed to duplicate the input validations and type definitions, even if we wrote JavaScript on both sides. The latter got simpler with the more widespread (re-)adoption of monorepos, as it got somewhat easier to share code across the whole system, even if it was built as a collection of microservices. But monorepos brought their own complications, not to mention distributed systems. And ever since 2012, I have had a feeling that whatever problem we solve generates 20 new ones. You could argue that this is called “progress”, but maybe merely out of romanticism, or longing for times past when things used to be simpler, I’ve been waiting for a “Node.js on Rails” for a while now. Meteor seemed like it could be the one, but it quickly fell out of favor, as the community mostly viewed it as something that is good for MVPs but does not scale… The Rails problem all over again, but breaking down at an earlier stage of the product lifecycle. I must admit, I never even got around to try it. However, it seemed like we were getting there slowly but steadily. Angular 2+ embraced the code generators á la Rails, alongside with Next.js, so it seemed like it could be something similar. Next.js got API Routes, making it possible to handle the front-end with SSR and write back-end APIs too. But it still lacks a powerful CLI generator and has nothing to do with the data layer either. And in general, a good ORM was still missing from the equation to reach the power level of Rails. At least this last point seems to be solved with Prisma being around now. Wait a minute. We have code generators, mature back-end and front-end frameworks, and finally, a good ORM. Maybe we have all pieces of the puzzle in place? Maybe. But first, let’s venture a bit further from JavaScript and see if another ecosystem has managed to further the legacy of Rails, and whether we can learn from it. Enter Elixir and Phoenix Elixir is a language built on Erlang’s BEAM and OTP, providing a nice concurrency model based on the actor model and processes, which also results in easy error handling due to the “let it crash” philosophy in contrast to defensive programming. It also has a nice, Ruby-inspired syntax, yet remains to be an elegant, functional language. Phoenix is built on top of Elixir’s capabilities, first as a simple reimplementation of Rails, with a powerful code generator, an data mapping toolkit (think ORM), good conventions, and generally good dev experience, with the inbuilt scalability of the OTP. Yeah.. So far, I wouldn’t have even raised an eyebrow. Rails got more scalable over time, and I can get most of the things I need from a framework writing JavaScript these days, even if wiring it all up is still pretty much DIY. Anyhow, if I need an interactive browser app, I’ll need to use something like React (or at least Alpine.js) to do it anyway. Boy, you can’t even start to imagine how wrong the previous statement is. While Phoenix is a full-fledged Rails reimplementation in Elixir, it has a cherry on top: your pages can be entirely server-side rendered and interactive at the same time, using its superpower called LiveView. When you request a LiveView page, the initial state gets prerendered on the server side, and then a WebSocket connection is built. The state is stored in memory on the server, and the client sends over events. The backend updates the state, calculates the diff, and sends over a highly compressed changeset to the UI, where a client-side JS library updates the DOM accordingly. I heavily oversimplified what Phoenix is capable of, but this section is already getting too long, so make sure to check it out yourself! We’ve taken a detour to look at one of the best, if not the best full-stack frameworks out there. So when it comes to full-stack JavaScript frameworks, it only makes sense to achieve at least what Phoenix has achieved. Thus, what I would want to see: A CLI that can generate data models or schemas, along with their controllers/services and their corresponding pages A powerful ORM like Prisma Server-side rendered but interactive pages, made simple Cross-platform usability: make it easy for me to create pages for the browser, but I want to be able to create an API endpoint responding with JSON by just adding a single line of code. Bundle this whole thing together With that said, let’s see whether Redwood or Blitz is the framework we have been waiting for. BlitzJS vs. RedwoodJS comparison What is RedwoodJS? Redwood markets itself as THE full-stack framework for startups. It is THE framework everyone has been waiting for, if not the best thing since the invention of sliced bread. End of story, this blog post is over. At least according to their tutorial. I felt a sort of boastful overconfidence while reading the docs, which I personally find difficult to read. The fact that it takes a lighter tone compared to the usual, dry, technical texts is a welcome change. Still, as a text moves away from the safe, objective description of things, it also wanders into the territory of matching or clashing with the reader’s taste. In my case, I admire the choice but could not enjoy the result. Still, the tutorial is worth reading through. It is very thorough and helpful. The result is also worth the… well, whatever you feel while reading it, as Redwood is also nice to work with. Its code generator does what I would expect it to do. Actually, it does even more than I expected, as it is very handy not just for setting up the app skeleton, models, pages, and other scaffolds. It even sets your app up to be deployed to different deployment targets like AWS Lambdas, Render, Netlify, Vercel. Speaking of the listed deployment targets, I have a feeling that Redwood pushes me a bit strongly towards serverless solutions, Render being the only one in the list where you have a constantly running service. And I like that idea too: if I have an opinionated framework, it sure can have its own opinions about how and where it wants to be deployed. As long as I’m free to disagree, of course. But Redwood has STRONG opinions not just about the deployment, but overall on how web apps should be developed, and if you don’t agree with those, well… I want you to use GraphQL Let’s take a look at a freshly generated Redwood app. Redwood has its own starter kit, so we don’t need to install anything, and we can get straight to creating a skeleton. $ yarn create redwood-app --ts ./my-redwood-app You can omit the --ts flag if you want to use plain JavaScript instead. Of course, you can immediately start up the development server and see that you got a nice UI already with yarn redwood dev. One thing to notice, which is quite commendable in my opinion, is that you don’t need to globally install a redwood CLI. Instead, it always remains project local, making collaboration easier. Now, let’s see the directory structure. my-redwood-app ├── api/ ├── scripts/ ├── web/ ├── graphql.config.js ├── jest.config.js ├── node_modules ├── package.json ├── prettier.config.js ├── README.md ├── redwood.toml ├── test.js └── yarn.lock We can see the regular prettier.config.js, jest.config.js, and there’s also a redwood.toml for configuring the port of the dev-server. We have an api and web directory for separating the front-end and the back-end into their own paths using yarn workspaces. But wait, we have a graphql.config.js too! That’s right, with Redwood, you’ll write a GraphQL API. Under the hood, Redwood uses Apollo on the front-end and Yoga on the back-end, but most of it is made pretty easy using the CLI. However, GraphQL has its downsides, and if you’re not OK with the tradeoff, well, you’re shit out of luck with Redwood. Let’s dive a bit deeper into the API. my-redwood-app ├── api │ ├── db │ │ └── schema.prisma │ ├── jest.config.js │ ├── package.json │ ├── server.config.js │ ├── src │ │ ├── directives │ │ │ ├── requireAuth │ │ │ │ ├── requireAuth.test.ts │ │ │ │ └── requireAuth.ts │ │ │ └── skipAuth │ │ │ ├── skipAuth.test.ts │ │ │ └── skipAuth.ts │ │ ├── functions │ │ │ └── graphql.ts │ │ ├── graphql │ │ ├── lib │ │ │ ├── auth.ts │ │ │ ├── db.ts │ │ │ └── logger.ts │ │ └── services │ ├── tsconfig.json │ └── types │ └── graphql.d.ts ... Here, we can see some more, backend related config files, and the debut of tsconfig.json. api/db/: Here resides our schema.prisma, which tells us the Redwood, of course, uses Prisma. The src/ dir stores the bulk of our logic. directives/: Stores our graphql schema directives. functions/: Here are the necessary lambda functions so we can deploy our app to a serverless cloud solution (remember STRONG opinions?). graphql/: Here reside our gql schemas, which can be generated automatically from our db schema. lib/: We can keep our more generic helper modules here. services/: If we generate a page, we’ll have a services/ directory, which will hold our actual business logic. This nicely maps to a layered architecture, where the GraphQL resolvers function as our controller layer. We have our services, and we can either create a repository or dal layer on top of Prisma, or if we can keep it simple, then use it as our data access tool straight away. So far so good. Let’s move to the front-end. my-redwood-app ├── web │ ├── jest.config.js │ ├── package.json │ ├── public │ │ ├── favicon.png │ │ ├── README.md │ │ └── robots.txt │ ├── src │ │ ├── App.tsx │ │ ├── components │ │ ├── index.css │ │ ├── index.html │ │ ├── layouts │ │ ├── pages │ │ │ ├── FatalErrorPage │ │ │ │ └── FatalErrorPage.tsx │ │ │ └── NotFoundPage │ │ │ └── NotFoundPage.tsx │ │ └── Routes.tsx │ └── tsconfig.json ... From the config file and the package.json, we can deduce we’re in a different workspace. The directory layout and file names also show us that this is not merely a repackaged Next.js app but something completely Redwood specific. Redwood comes with its router, which is heavily inspired by React Router. I found this a bit annoying as the dir structure-based one in Next.js feels a lot more convenient, in my opinion. However, a downside of Redwood is that it does not support server-side rendering, only static site generation. Right, SSR is its own can of worms, and while currently you probably want to avoid it even when using Next, with the introduction of Server Components this might soon change, and it will be interesting to see how Redwood will react (pun not intended). On the other hand, Next.js is notorious for the hacky way you need to use layouts with it (which will soon change though), while Redwood handles them as you’d expect it. In Routes.tsx, you simply need to wrap your Routes in a Set block to tell Redwood what layout you want to use for a given route, and never think about it again. import { Router, Route, Set } from \"@redwoodjs/router\"; import BlogLayout from \"src/layouts/BlogLayout/\"; const Routes = () => { return ( <Router> <Route path=\"/login\" page={LoginPage} name=\"login\" /> <Set wrap={BlogLayout}> <Route path=\"/article/{id:Int}\" page={ArticlePage} name=\"article\" /> <Route path=\"/\" page={HomePage} name=\"home\" /> </Set> <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} /> </Router> ); }; export default Routes; Notice that you don’t need to import the page components, as it is handled automatically. Why can’t we also auto-import the layouts though, as for example Nuxt 3 would? Beats me. Another thing to note is the /article/{id:Int} part. Gone are the days when you always need to make sure to convert your integer ids if you get them from a path variable, as Redwood can convert them automatically for you, given you provide the necessary type hint. Now’s a good time to take a look at SSG. The NotFoundPage probably doesn’t have any dynamic content, so we can generate it statically. Just add prerender, and you’re good. const Routes = () => { return ( <Router> ... <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} prerender /> </Router> ); }; export default Routes; You can also tell Redwood that some of your pages require authentication. Unauthenticated users should be redirected if they try to request it. import { Private, Router, Route, Set } from \"@redwoodjs/router\"; import BlogLayout from \"src/layouts/BlogLayout/\"; const Routes = () => { return ( <Router> <Route path=\"/login\" page={LoginPage} name=\"login\" /> <Private unauthenticated=\"login\"> <Set wrap={PostsLayout}> <Route path=\"/admin/posts/new\" page={PostNewPostPage} name=\"newPost\" /> <Route path=\"/admin/posts/{id:Int}/edit\" page={PostEditPostPage} name=\"editPost\" /> </Set> </Private> <Set wrap={BlogLayout}> <Route path=\"/article/{id:Int}\" page={ArticlePage} name=\"article\" /> <Route path=\"/\" page={HomePage} name=\"home\" /> </Set> <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} /> </Router> ); }; export default Routes; Of course, you need to protect your mutations and queries, too. So make sure to append them with the pre-generated @requireAuth. Another nice thing in Redwood is that you might not want to use a local auth strategy but rather outsource the problem of user management to an authentication provider, like Auth0 or Netlify-Identity. Redwood’s CLI can install the necessary packages and generate the required boilerplate automatically. What looks strange, however, at least with local auth, is that the client makes several roundtrips to the server to get the token. More specifically, the server will be hit for each currentUser or isAuthenticated call. Frontend goodies in Redwood There are two things that I really loved about working with Redwood: Cells and Forms. A cell is a component that fetches and manages its own data and state. You define the queries and mutations it will use, and then export a function for rendering the Loading, Empty, Failure, and Success states of the component. Of course, you can use the generator to create the necessary boilerplate for you. A generated cell looks like this: import type { ArticlesQuery } from \"types/graphql\"; import type { CellSuccessProps, CellFailureProps } from \"@redwoodjs/web\"; export const QUERY = gql` query ArticlesQuery { articles { id } } `; export const Loading = () => <div>Loading...</div>; export const Empty = () => <div>Empty</div>; export const Failure = ({ error }: CellFailureProps) => ( <div style={{ color: \"red\" }}>Error: {error.message}</div> ); export const Success = ({ articles }: CellSuccessProps<ArticlesQuery>) => { return ( <ul> {articles.map((item) => { return <li key={item.id}>{JSON.stringify(item)}</li>; })} </ul> ); }; Then you just import and use it as you would any other component, for example, on a page. import ArticlesCell from \"src/components/ArticlesCell\"; const HomePage = () => { return ( <> <MetaTags title=\"Home\" description=\"Home page\" /> <ArticlesCell /> </> ); }; export default HomePage; However! If you use SSG on pages with cells — or any dynamic content really —only their loading state will get pre-rendered, which is not much of a help. That’s right, no getStaticProps for you if you go with Redwood. The other somewhat nice thing about Redwood is the way it eases form handling, though the way they frame it leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. But first, the pretty part. import { Form, FieldError, Label, TextField } from \"@redwoodjs/forms\"; const ContactPage = () => { return ( <> <Form config={{ mode: \"onBlur\" }}> <Label name=\"email\" errorClassName=\"error\"> Email </Label> <TextField name=\"email\" validation={{ required: true, pattern: { value: /^[^@]+@[^.]+\\..+$/, message: \"Please enter a valid email address\", }, }} errorClassName=\"error\" /> <FieldError name=\"email\" className=\"error\" /> </Form> </> ); }; The TextField components validation attribute expects an object to be passed, with a pattern against which the provided input value can be validated. The errorClassName makes it easy to set the style of the text field and its label in case the validation fails, e.g. turning it red. The validations message will be printed in the FieldError component. Finally, the config={{ mode: 'onBlur' }} tells the form to validate each field when the user leaves them. The only thing that spoils the joy is the fact that this pattern is eerily similar to the one provided by Phoenix. Don’t get me wrong. It is perfectly fine, even virtuous, to copy what’s good in other frameworks. But I got used to paying homage when it’s due. Of course, it’s totally possible that the author of the tutorial did not know about the source of inspiration for this pattern. If that’s the case, let me know, and I’m happy to open a pull request to the docs, adding that short little sentence of courtesy. But let’s continue and take a look at the whole working form. import { MetaTags, useMutation } from \"@redwoodjs/web\"; import { toast, Toaster } from \"@redwoodjs/web/toast\"; import { FieldError, Form, FormError, Label, Submit, SubmitHandler, TextAreaField, TextField, useForm, } from \"@redwoodjs/forms\"; import { CreateContactMutation, CreateContactMutationVariables, } from \"types/graphql\"; const CREATE_CONTACT = gql` mutation CreateContactMutation($input: CreateContactInput!) { createContact(input: $input) { id } } `; interface FormValues { name: string; email: string; message: string; } const ContactPage = () => { const formMethods = useForm(); const [create, { loading, error }] = useMutation< CreateContactMutation, CreateContactMutationVariables >(CREATE_CONTACT, { onCompleted: () => { toast.success(\"Thank you for your submission!\"); formMethods.reset(); }, }); const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<FormValues> = (data) => { create({ variables: { input: data } }); }; return ( <> <MetaTags title=\"Contact\" description=\"Contact page\" /> <Toaster /> <Form onSubmit={onSubmit} config={{ mode: \"onBlur\" }} error={error} formMethods={formMethods} > <FormError error={error} wrapperClassName=\"form-error\" /> <Label name=\"email\" errorClassName=\"error\"> Email </Label> <TextField name=\"email\" validation={{ required: true, pattern: { value: /^[^@]+@[^.]+\\..+$/, message: \"Please enter a valid email address\", }, }} errorClassName=\"error\" /> <FieldError name=\"email\" className=\"error\" /> <Submit disabled={loading}>Save</Submit> </Form> </> ); }; export default ContactPage; Yeah, that’s quite a mouthful. But this whole thing is necessary if we want to properly handle submissions and errors returned from the server. We won’t dive deeper into it now, but if you’re interested, make sure to take a look at Redwood’s really nicely written and thorough tutorial. Now compare this with how it would look like in Phoenix LiveView. <div> <.form let={f} for={@changeset} id=\"contact-form\" phx-target={@myself} phx-change=\"validate\" phx-submit=\"save\"> <%= label f, :title %> <%= text_input f, :title %> <%= error_tag f, :title %> <div> <button type=\"submit\" phx-disable-with=\"Saving...\">Save</button> </div> </.form> </div> A lot easier to see through while providing almost the same functionality. Yes, you’d be right to call me out for comparing apples to oranges. One is a template language, while the other is JSX. Much of the logic in a LiveView happens in an elixir file instead of the template, while JSX is all about combining the logic with the view. However, I’d argue that an ideal full-stack framework should allow me to write the validation code once for inputs, then let me simply provide the slots in the view to insert the error messages into, and allow me to set up the conditional styles for invalid inputs and be done with it. This would provide a way to write cleaner code on the front-end, even when using JSX. You could say this is against the original philosophy of React, and my argument merely shows I have a beef with it. And you’d probably be right to do so. But this is an opinion article about opinionated frameworks, after all, so that’s that. The people behind RedwoodJS Credit, where credit is due. Redwood was created by GitHub co-founder and former CEO Tom Preston-Werner, Peter Pistorius, David Price & Rob Cameron. Moreover, its core team currently consists of 23 people. So if you’re afraid to try out newish tools because you may never know when their sole maintainer gets tired of the struggles of working on a FOSS tool in their free time, you can rest assured: Redwood is here to stay. Redwood: Honorable mentions Redwood also comes bundled with Storybook, provides the must-have graphiql-like GraphQL Playground, provides accessibility features out of the box like the RouteAnnouncemnet SkipNavLink, SkipNavContent and RouteFocus components, of course it automatically splits your code by pages. The last one is somewhat expected in 2022, while the accessibility features would deserve their own post in general. Still, this one is getting too long already, and we haven’t even mentioned the other contender yet. Let’s see BlitzJS Blitz is built on top of Next.js, and it is inspired by Ruby on Rails and provides a “Zero-API” data layer abstraction. No GraphQL, pays homage to predecessors… seems like we’re off to a good start. But does it live up to my high hopes? Sort of. A troubled past Compared to Redwood, Blitz’s tutorial and documentation are a lot less thorough and polished. It also lacks several convenience features: It does not really autogenerate host-specific config files. Blitz cannot run a simple CLI command to set up auth providers. It does not provide accessibility helpers. Its code generator does not take into account the model when generating pages. Blitz’s initial commit was made in February 2020, a bit more than half a year after Redwood’s in June 2019, and while Redwood has a sizable number of contributors, Blitz’s core team consists of merely 2-4 people. In light of all this, I think they deserve praise for their work. But that’s not all. If you open up their docs, you’ll be greeted with a banner on top announcing a pivot. While Blitz originally included Next.js and was built around it, Brandon Bayer and the other developers felt it was too limiting. Thus they forked it, which turned out to be a pretty misguided decision. It quickly became obvious that maintaining the fork would take a lot more effort than the team could invest. All is not lost, however. The pivot aims to turn the initial value proposition “JavaScript on Rails with Next” into “JavaScript on Rails, bring your own Front-end Framework”. And I can’t tell you how relieved I am that this recreation of Rails won’t force me to use React. Don’t get me wrong. I love the inventiveness that React brought to the table. Front-end development has come a long way in the last nine years, thanks to React. Other frameworks like Vue and Svelte might lack behind in following the new concepts, but this also means they have more time to polish those ideas even further and provide better DevX. Or at least I find them a lot easier to work with without ever being afraid that my client-side code’s performance would grind to a standstill. All in all, I find this turn of events a lucky blunder. How to create a Blitz app You’ll need to install Blitz globally (run yarn global add blitz or npm install -g blitz –legacy-peer-deps), before you create a Blitz app. That’s possibly my main woe when it comes to Blitz’s design, as this way, you cannot lock your project across all contributors to use a given Blitz CLI version and increment it when you see fit, as Blitz will automatically update itself from time to time. Once blitz is installed, run $ blitz new my-blitz-app It will ask you whether you want to use TS or JS, if it should include a DB and Auth template (more on that later), if you want to use npm, yarn or pnpm to install dependencies, and if you want to use React Final Form or React Hook Form. Once you have answered all its questions, the CLI starts to download half of the internet, as it is customary. Grab something to drink, have a lunch, finish your workout session, or whatever you do to pass the time and when you’re done, you can fire up the server by running $ blitz dev And, of course, you’ll see the app running and the UI telling you to run $ blitz generate all project name:string But before we do that, let’s look around in the project directory. my-blitz-app/ ├── app/ ├── db/ ├── mailers/ ├── node_modules/ ├── public/ ├── test/ ├── integrations/ ├── babel.config.js ├── blitz.config.ts ├── blitz-env.d.ts ├── jest.config.ts ├── package.json ├── README.md ├── tsconfig.json ├── types.ts └── yarn.lock Again, we can see the usual suspects: config files, node_modules, test, and the likes. The public directory — to no one’s surprise — is the place where you store your static assets. Test holds your test setup and utils. Integrations is for configuring your external services, like a payment provider or a mailer. Speaking of the mailer, that is where you can handle your mail-sending logic. Blitz generates a nice template with informative comments for you to get started, including a forgotten password email template. As you’d probably guessed, the app and db directories are the ones where you have the bulk of your app-related code. Now’s the time to do as the generated landing page says and run blitz generate all project name:string. Say yes, when it asks you if you want to migrate your database and give it a descriptive name like add project. Now let’s look at the db directory. my-blitz-app/ └── db/ ├── db.sqlite ├── db.sqlite-journal ├── index.ts ├── migrations/ │ ├── 20220610075814_initial_migration/ │ │ └── migration.sql │ ├── 20220610092949_add_project/ │ │ └── migration.sql │ └── migration_lock.toml ├── schema.prisma └── seeds.ts The migrations directory is handled by Prisma, so it won’t surprise you if you’re already familiar with it. If not, I highly suggest trying it out on its own before you jump into using either Blitz or Redwood, as they heavily and transparently rely on it. Just like in Redwood’s db dir, we have our schema.prisma, and our sqlite db, so we have something to start out with. But we also have a seeds.ts and index.ts. If you take a look at the index.ts file, it merely re-exports Prisma with some enhancements, while the seeds.ts file kind of speaks for itself. Now’s the time to take a closer look at our schema.prisma. // This is your Prisma schema file, // learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema datasource db { provider = \"sqlite\" url = env(\"DATABASE_URL\") } generator client { provider = \"prisma-client-js\" } // -------------------------------------- model User { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) createdAt DateTime @default(now()) updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt name String? email String @unique hashedPassword String? role String @default(\"USER\") tokens Token[] sessions Session[] } model Session { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) createdAt DateTime @default(now()) updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt expiresAt DateTime? handle String @unique hashedSessionToken String? antiCSRFToken String? publicData String? privateData String? user User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) userId Int? } model Token { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) createdAt DateTime @default(now()) updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt hashedToken String type String // See note below about TokenType enum // type TokenType expiresAt DateTime sentTo String user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id]) userId Int @@unique([hashedToken, type]) } // NOTE: It's highly recommended to use an enum for the token type // but enums only work in Postgres. // See: https://blitzjs.com/docs/database-overview#switch-to-postgre-sql // enum TokenType { // RESET_PASSWORD // } model Project { id Int @id @default(autoincrement()) createdAt DateTime @default(now()) updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt name String } As you can see, Blitz starts out with models to be used with a fully functional User management. Of course, it also provides all the necessary code in the app scaffold, meaning that the least amount of logic is abstracted away, and you are free to modify it as you see fit. Below all the user-related models, we can see the Project model we created with the CLI, with an automatically added id, createdAt, and updatedAt files. One of the things that I prefer in Blitz over Redwood is that its CLI mimics Phoenix, and you can really create everything from the command line end-to-end. This really makes it easy to move quickly, as less context switching happens between the code and the command line. Well, it would if it actually worked, as while you can generate the schema properly, the generated pages, mutations, and queries always use name: string, and disregard the entity type defined by the schema, unlike Redwood. There’s already an open pull request to fix this, but the Blitz team understandably has been focusing on getting v2.0 done instead of patching up the current stable branch. That’s it for the db, let’s move on to the app directory. my-blitz-app └── app ├── api/ ├── auth/ ├── core/ ├── pages/ ├── projects/ └── users/ The core directory contains Blitz goodies, like a predefined and parameterized Form (without Redwood’s or Phoenix’s niceties though), a useCurrentUser hook, and a Layouts directory, as Bliz made it easy to persist layouts between pages, which will be rendered completely unnecessary with the upcoming Next.js Layouts. This reinforces further that the decision to ditch the fork and pivot to a toolkit was probably a difficult but necessary decision. The auth directory contains the fully functional authentication logic we talked about earlier, with all the necessary database mutations such as signup, login, logout, and forgotten password, with their corresponding pages and a signup and login form component. The getCurrentUser query got its own place in the users directory all by itself, which makes perfect sense. And we got to the pages and projects directories, where all the action happens. Blitz creates a directory to store database queries, mutations, input validations (using zod), and model-specific components like create and update forms in one place. You will need to fiddle around in these a lot, as you will need to update them according to your actual model. This is nicely laid out though in the tutorial… Be sure to read it, unlike I did when I first tried Blitz out. my-blitz-app/ └── app/ └── projects/ ├── components/ │ └── ProjectForm.tsx ├── mutations/ │ ├── createProject.ts │ ├── deleteProject.ts │ └── updateProject.ts └── queries/ ├── getProjects.ts └── getProject.ts Whereas the pages directory won’t be of any surprise if you’re already familiar with Next. my-blitz-app/ └── app/ └── pages/ ├── projects/ │ ├── index.tsx │ ├── new.tsx │ ├── [projectId]/ │ │ └── edit.tsx │ └── [projectId].tsx ├── 404.tsx ├── _app.tsx ├── _document.tsx ├── index.test.tsx └── index.tsx A bit of explanation if you haven’t tried Next out yet: Blitz uses file-system-based routing just like Next. The pages directory is your root, and the index file is rendered when the path corresponding to a given directory is accessed. Thus when the root path is requested, pages/index.tsx will be rendered, accessing /projects will render pages/projects/index.tsx, /projects/new will render pages/projects/new.tsx and so on. If a filename is enclosed in []-s, it means that it corresponds to a route param. Thus /projects/15 will render pages/projects/[projectId].tsx. Unlike in Next, you access the param’s value within the page using the <code>useParam(name: string, type?: string)</code> hook. To access the query object, use the <code>useRouterQuery(name: string)</code>. To be honest, I never really understood why Next needs to mesh together the two. When you generate pages using the CLI, all pages are protected by default. To make them public, simply delete the [PageComponent].authenticate = true line. This will throw an AuthenticationError if the user is not logged in anyway, so if you’d rather redirect unauthenticated users to your login page, you probably want to use [PageComponent].authenticate = {redirectTo: '/login'}. In your queries and mutations, you can use the ctx context arguments value to call ctx.session.$authorize or resolver.authorize in a pipeline to secure your data. Finally, if you still need a proper http API, you can create Express-style handler functions, using the same file-system routing as for your pages. A possible bright future While Blitz had a troubled past, it might have a bright future. It is still definitely in the making and not ready for widespread adoption. The idea of creating a framework agnostic full-stack JavaScript toolkit is a versatile concept. This strong concept is further reinforced by the good starting point, which is the current stable version of Blitz. I’m looking further to see how the toolkit will evolve over time. Redwood vs. Blitz: Comparison and Conclusion I set out to see whether we have a Rails, or even better, Phoenix equivalent in JavaScript. Let’s see how they measured up. 1. CLI code generator Redwood’s CLI gets the checkmark on this one, as it is versatile, and does what it needs to do. The only small drawback is that the model has to be written in file first, and cannot be generated. Blitz’s CLI is still in the making, but that’s true about Blitz in general, so it’s not fair to judge it by what’s ready, but only by what it will be. In that sense, Blitz would win if it was fully functional (or will when it will be), as it can really generate pages end-to-end. Verdict: Tie 2. A powerful ORM That’s a short one. Both use Prisma, which is a powerful enough ORM. Verdict: Tie 3. Server side rendered but interactive pages Well, in today’s ecosystem, that might be wishful thinking. Even in Next, SSR is something you should avoid, at least until we’ll have Server Components in React. But which one mimics this behavior the best? Redwood does not try to look like a Rails replacement. It has clear boundaries demarcated by yarn workspaces between front-end and back-end . It definitely provides nice conventions and — to keep it charitable — nicely reinvented the right parts of Phoenix’s form handling. However, strictly relying on GraphQL feels a bit overkill. For small apps that we start out with anyway when opting to use a full-stack framework, it definitely feels awkward. Redwood is also React exclusive, so if you prefer using Vue, Svelte or Solid, then you have to wait until someone reimplements Redwood for your favorite framework. Blitz follows the Rails way, but the controller layer is a bit more abstract. This is understandable, though, as using Next’s file-system-based routing, a lot of things that made sense for Rails do not make sense for Blitz. And in general, it feels more natural than using GraphQL for everything. In the meantime, becoming framework agnostic makes it even more versatile than Redwood. Moreover, Blitz is on its way to becoming framework agnostic, so even if you’d never touch React, you’ll probably be able to see its benefits in the near future. But to honor the original criterion: Redwood provides client-side rendering and SSG (kind of), while Blitz provides SSR on top of the previous two. Verdict: Die-hard GraphQL fans will probably want to stick with Redwood. But according to my criteria, Blitz hands down wins this one. 4. API Blitz auto generates an API for data access that you can use if you want to, but you can explicitly write handler functions too. A little bit awkward, but the possibility is there. Redwood maintains a hard separation between front-end and back-end, so it is trivial that you have an API, to begin with. Even if it’s a GraphQL API, that might just be way too much to engineer for your needs. Verdict: Tie (TBH, I feel like they both suck at this the same amount.) Bye now! In summary, Redwood is a production-ready, React+GraphQL-based full-stack JavaScript framework made for the edge. It does not follow the patterns laid down by Rails at all, except for being highly opinionated. It is a great tool to use if you share its sentiment, but my opinion greatly differs from Redwood’s on what makes development effective and enjoyable. Blitz, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Rails and Next, and is becoming a framework agnostic, full-stack toolkit that eliminates the need for an API layer. I hope you found this comparison helpful. Leave a comment if you agree with my conclusion and share my love for Blitz. If you don’t, argue with the enlightened ones… they say controversy boosts visitor numbers. *i*es L*i*es *e.js Consulting DevOps, SRE & Cloud Consul*ent & Code Re* for Software Developers * Building Complex Apps with A*.",

Last updated: October 24, 2022 *e.js Consulting De*ting 24.7 Node.js Support Infrastructu*i*es Learn more at risingstack.com * In this article: Tamas Kadlecsik As organizations grow and evolve, they need to adapt to the challenges of managing more and more people and respond to the changing landscape they operate in. However, growing the team without keeping developer satisfaction in mind can lead to long-time staff members becoming jaded and burned out. This leads to a high turnover rate as well as valuable knowledge becoming unavailable over time. Recently, we were approached by a leading European online travel agency who recognized these symptoms so common to scale-ups. Initially, they hired us to advise them on technical and architectural questions, but we ended up providing organizational and engineering process-related consultation too, which helped them improve their development processes and get rid of some of their unrecognized communication problems. In the following case study we outline the work done by RisingStack, with the intention of helping IT decision makers through sharing our experiences. Architectural Consulting The first part of our assignment centered around the introduction of microservices as well as common modern practices such as automated testing improvements, CI/CD workflow, code reviews, and such. Whenever it comes to fundamentally overhauling an architecture, we need to look deeper to see what problems lurk behind these proposed changes and whether undertaking this shift is achievable. To uncover issues that might hinder our plans, we agreed with our client to thoroughly investigate the situation by: Getting a full picture on the technical aspects of day-to-day development: The codebase, the development cycle, and the deployment process. Understanding the organization and the flow of information within it: How are the long-term development roadmaps created? How are they translated into epics and stories? What is the flow of information from where the idea of a new feature or general functionality is conceived to the actual development of it? How do developed features get accepted? First, we assessed the current state of the codebase and deployments. Both of them were generally well thought out, but two things stood out: The majority of lines changed in the past couple of years belonged to a handful of people despite the organization employing around 20 developers. A lot of code hasn’t been touched for years, while other parts of the code essentially solved the same problem that has been worked on in the recent past. The first point hinted at the heavy reliance on silos in the organization, while the second one showed symptoms of poor communication. Understanding How the Organization Works Next, we started conducting interviews with all related parties, beginning with the C-level executives and directors. We needed to get a sense of the organizational structures we were dealing with. According to them, the company was split up into 5 departments. Finance Sales / Business Development Marketing Development Customer service As all five departments could submit development needs, they maintained the product’s roadmap together. Based on the roadmap, Product Owners supervised the planning of new features and functionalities. The plans were mostly created by the UX team. These were chunked up into development projects carried out by the development teams using the agile methodology. Teams were also aided by a Project Manager whose job was to ensure the development was progressing according to the plan. Or at least that was the shared belief of how the organization works. However, the nicely drawn organizational diagrams seldom reflect the truth on the day-to-day reality of teamwork. To discover the actual, informal organizational structure we conducted interviews with every team, every single person within the company who had anything to do with the product. Beyond C-level execs and directors, we also interviewed product and project managers, tech leads, developers, QA engineers, and manual testers. Uncovering the Informal Flow of Knowledge During these interviews we were able to understand the history of this company’s development, and how growth affected their way of conducting business. Initially the company functioned like a small startup. With only a couple of developers, people could just nudge each other in the office, ask for something to be done, and deliver features. If a request was overheard by another stakeholder, it might have been challenged or deprioritized. The company worked completely informally, yet very efficiently. No lengthy meetings, no unnecessary planning, just people deciding how to spend their time most effectively to achieve common goals. This worked perfectly while there were only a handful of stakeholders in the organization, however, as the company grew, it needed to get organized, and thus emerged the 5 departments. Still, the leaders of said departments could easily reach the developers if they needed something. Our client’s product had key advantages compared to its Central European competitors, which made it the undisputed leader of the market in this geographical area. These specific features could only be developed by one person at a time, so the other developers were helping out where they could, to make themselves useful in the meantime. The channels of favors were formalized, resulting in the requests that previously were mere favors becoming mandatory tasks, those who asked for these favors in turn became supervisors to developers. By 2017 the product was basically done, no development happened on its core, besides marketing campaigns or sales-deal related updates. However, these sales related requests started becoming more and more ambitious, requiring more and more work, thus our client started hiring more and more developers. This was necessary for another reason too: developers started leaving the company, leaving just a handful of old-time developers in the organization, and only 2 of them wrote code actively. The others got appointed into leadership roles. However, more people did not result in faster delivery times, and people had to crunch more and more to meet their targets, which were missed by bigger and bigger margins. On the business side, as time went by since its founding, our client’s product quickly overgrew its initial national market. It needed to look for other areas in Central Europe. They could maintain growth by acquiring other businesses, thus innovation was not key for a couple of years to their success. However, through these acquisitions, the company’s application portfolio became so fragmented that it became unwieldy to manage: a large overhaul was necessary to unify these acquired products, which led to the need for more organized development. At this point, in 2019, they hired a consultant to help them rectify their processes and update their organizational structure, but as usual, they only got to the formal level: leaders were consulted, a nice structural diagram was drawn, development teams were created, but the informal channels of favors-later-task-requests remained. Aligning the formal and informal way of working While in theory there was a roadmap to follow, and there were people appointed for the supervision of different aspects of the work, the day-to-day reality was pretty far from the formally defined organization. It became clear that we needed to find the necessary missing pieces that prevented the reorganized structure from taking hold. During the interviews, different people raised seemingly unrelated issues, but at the end three overarching themes emerged: The lack of knowledge of the actual application within the company The lack of a company-wide definition of done The exclusion of developers from setting deadlines The first was a tricky one: because everyone had some sense of what the application was capable of, it was never stated explicitly, except for newcomers. When we got a tour of the application it was seemingly thorough and complete. However, during group interviews people kept correcting each other on specific edge cases they needed to handle. So while we got a static picture of the application, when we went back asking about specific capabilities, it became clear that the knowledge seems to be lost, mostly because the person responsible for a given functionality has already left. However, manual testers had a pretty good grasp of both the general functionalities and edge cases too. It has also turned out during the interviews that they maintained a sort of “User Manual” of the product, that was a couple of hundred pages long, and no-one ever read it. Thus, in order for this knowledge to be available during the planning of given functionalities, we suggested that the relevant manual testers should be a part of the planning and design process, so no contradicting and superfluous features would be commissioned. The second turned out to be the missing keystone of the organizational shift. While each team, and each organizational unit had their own definition of done, there was no company wide one. This way, the development practices and expectations of different actors were completely out of sync with each other. This also meant that developers had initially no easy way of pushing back on those who used to ask for favors or later create tasks for them, as it would have required too much explaining. Not being able to push back on requests resulted in the old ways trumping the organizational structure. We advised all departments and business leaders to agree on a definition of done. Lastly, while everyone thought that developers were included in the planning of projects, this usually happened after the commitment has been made to partners or clients. Thus resulting in unrealistic expectations towards the developers, and not providing them enough room to make these on-off solutions scalable and maintainable. We advised to update the deal making process, to include consultation with Development before taking on any commitments. Did it work? We followed up on the progress 3 months later. While the involvement of testers into planning resulted in some initial pushback from the department heads, they got included into the design process, which almost immediately resulted in better alignment between the teams, as finally, testers became officially appointed as “keepers of truth” regarding the product as it is, creating a mental connection for questions that seemed unanswerable before. To put it simply: no-one ever considered asking the question “how does this actually work now”, besides consulting the codebase, and even if it did, manual testers never came to their minds. This led to better information sharing and collaboration between the teams, as they were freed from the toil of investigating and rediscovering modes of operation of the application. The definition of done was a more pronounced success, ss the head of development and the development teams have previously agreed on a development flow, which would have been a fairly standard one: development <-> unit testing <-> code review -> QA -> done ⌃ ⌃ |*_________________________| This previously agreed upon flow was never implemented due to the shortcomings detailed above, but after our consultation, it finally came through. Taking the time to explain other departments on the process, and having them accept that a feature is not simply done upon the first completion of the code, letting them understand the need for QA made it easier to push back on favors and allowed the organization to take a shape that was closer to the formal one. However, this would not have been possible without reducing crunches. With bringing developers closer to the actual deals, consulting them on what can be done at the moment easily, and what needs extensive development, while incorporating these investigations and their current development schedule into the deal making process (and the added benefit that they could rely on the knowledge accumulated by manual testers), crunches became rarer, deadlines became more realistic and less often missed and the business side became more satisfied with the development’s work too.

You can give it a go using the --experimental-websocket flag. The current implementation allows for opening and closing of websocket connections and sending data. flush option for the writeFile type filesystem functions: Up until now, it was possible for data to not be flushed immediately to permanent storage when a write operation completed successfully, allowing read operations to get stale data. In response, a flush option has been added to the fs module file writing functions that, when enabled, forces data to be flushed at the end of a successful write operation using sync. Addition of a global navigator Object: This new release also introduces a global navigator object to take steps towards enhancing web interoperability. We can now access hardware concurrency information through navigator.hardwareConcurrency, the only currently implemented method on the object. Array grouping: There is a new static method added to Object and Map, groupBy(), that groups the items of a given iterable according to a provided callback function. Additional changes: Both the fetch and the webstreams modules are now marked as stable after receiving a few changes with this version.

All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers. Do we use 'cookies'? Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.

We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings.

Third-party disclosure We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your * unless we provide users with advance notice.

We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. Google Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en We may use Google AdSense Advertising on our website. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy. If we happen to use Adsense, we will implement the following: • DoubleClick Platform Integration We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website. Opting out: Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt-out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser add-on. California Online Privacy Protection Act CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting * from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home-page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: • On our Privacy Policy Page Can change your personal information: • By logging into your account How does our site handle Do Not Track signals? We don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because: we don't have the technical means. Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking? It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking. COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. CAN-SPAM Act The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. We collect your email address in order to: • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions • Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders. • Send you additional information related to your product and/or service • Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred. To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following: • Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses. • Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way. • Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters. • Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance if one is used. • Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly. • Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.

    "text": " * About Awesome Node.js Awesome Node.js is a community effort. The primary listings are based on the official Awesome Node.js list at GitHub. New useful libraries and projects are added to the list almost every day. nodejs.libhunt.com contains 925 projects categorized into 75 different categories. Our end goal is to help developers * they need to get their job done. If you wish to add a new library or a related open source project to this site, you have to open a pull request at the official repository. At nodejs.libhunt.com you can see the popularity and activity of all projects that have a known Git repository. The popularity of every library is between 0 and 10, where 10 is the most popular library at \"Awesome Node.js\" - Next.js. Then, if a library has a popularity of 9.0, it means that it is among the top 10% of the most popular projects, and 2.5, for example, means that a given library is more popular than 25% of the projects only. The activity is measured between 0 and 10 again and is based on the number of commits. Recent commits have a higher weight than older commits. For example, a library with 10 commits made during the last week, would have higher activity than a library with 20 commits made 3 months ago. An \"Activity\" of zero means that there haven't been any commits for the last year. A useful feature of nodejs.libhunt.com is comparing libraries. When you open a library's page, you will see a list of all other projects from the same category at the bottom and a context \"VS\" link. More over, you can browse the enhanced the changelogs of all projects.

    "text": " * Awesome Node.js Changelogs Awesome Node.js has a \"changelog\" section under all projects. You can find it next to the \"Repo\" button in the header. There are two features that make it unique. It is an aggregation of parsed \"CHANGELOG.md\" files and releases information from Github. This way, it is easier to see all changes in a single place and a uniform style. All changelogs are \"emojified\". This helps with identifying each change easier. Emojification is achieved by parsing each line and applying a specific emoji based on the first word or some other tokens. The combination of the above two makes module changelogs on Awesome Node.js unique. As you know, an example is worth a 1,000 words 🚀 Changelog examples RxDB 7.4.3 (April 01, 72018) 🛠 Bugfixes: Sort by sub object is not working #585 Encrypted attachments not working inside of electron-renderer #587 Schema fails with sub-sub-index #590 Default value not applied when the stored value is undefined #596 Cliffy 2.4.1 (October 15, 20202) 🛠 Fixed A bug that allowed users to pass more parameters than were allowed by a command.

We are excited to announce some significant updates to this repo that include a large number of items related to user requests. (Note that there is an important point in the section below about using the new repo as the old repo will remain available but no longer be supported with new versions) We handle over 100 million downloads of the open-source binaries each year, developers rely on our timely releases (fastest in the ecosystem) and tooling to simplify their use of the Node.js Runtime. Every time there is a release, including security updates, our team delivers updates in less than 48 hours. Img 1- Type of Distributions As part of our ongoing commitment to the ecosystem, we want to ensure that developers who rely on our repository have access to a robust and efficient resource led by our Node experts. A key objective with this update was to enhance the Node.js package distribution experience, making it more intuitive, feature-rich, and responsive to user needs. In the following sections, we'll dive into the improvements we've made, highlighting the changes that promise to make your development journey easier. Check it out HERE and let us know your thoughts! New Features Version Choice (Made Easy): We have added versatility with the latest update to our repository, gone are the days of being locked into the latest Node.js release. Now, you can choose the specific version of Node.js you need to tailor your environment to the unique needs of your project. Universal distribution support: Say goodbye to server customization and compatibility concerns. Our repository now seamlessly supports all distributions. You don't need to adjust for each new OS version, all are supported out-of-the-box. Seamless CDN transition: We've revamped our CDN provider to address cache-related issues. This change ensures a smoother, more reliable experience and eliminates cache-related hiccups.. Streamlined installation requirements: Installing Node.js should be a snap. That's why we've carefully configured the necessary installation requirements. The package now includes the required glibc and Python3 configurations, making the setup more accessible. Simplified installation process: Recognizing the diversity of our user base, we've redesigned the installation process—no more complex scripts to decipher. Instead, we've streamlined it to a few simple lines of code. Installation is now easy and accessible for users of all skill levels. These improvements demonstrate our commitment to providing a repository experience that keeps pace with technological demands and prioritizes user convenience and satisfaction. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use the new repository! Failing to migrate to the new repository could be significant, most notably is the potential denial of access to the latest versions of Node.js. Because these latest versions will be distributed exclusively through the new repository, those who do not migrate will miss important updates, improvements, and features. For more information on the new repository including details regarding the migration process, we recommend you visit the following link for the repository wiki, which provides comprehensive information on making a successful transition. Our Distributions Journey Our mission to help developers gain access to Node.js and enable the enterprise to adopt it safely has been a key driver for our binary distribution effort. We have seen tremendous growth in the number of downloads every year from our distributions across the globe. Img 2- Request per Country and Data Transfer by Country per 24H Our flagship product, N|Solid, an enterprise-grade version of the Node.js Runtime, is a testament to this devotion to OSS, and was a key part of why we created this repo that is used by millions of developers to power a massive number of applications. Our Node and Infra experts will continue to support this repo for the community with great pride. > This repository has seen a staggering number of annual package downloads, over 120 million, and a data consumption rate of around 300 terabytes per month. This endeavor hasn't been without its challenges, as maintaining such a repository has required extraordinary dedication and effort. Earlier this year we made the decision to open-source our N|Solid Runtime marking a key turning point for NodeSource, inspiring us to extend our commitment to the repository. (The OSS version of N|Solid will be available in October of this year) > Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between Node.js and N|Solid, we decided to merge their paths. By distributing Node.js and N|Solid together, we're creating a unified ecosystem that takes advantage of the power of Node combined with the advancements of N|Solid. This dynamic coupling invites those familiar with our repository to explore what we refer to as \"enterprise Node.js,\" or the Node.js that enterprises have been waiting for. This synergy is a testament to our commitment to both the Node.js community and the growth of enterprise-grade solutions. Conclusion As we embark on this transformative phase, we reflect on our journey in this ecosystem. We've been privileged to play a role in supporting developers and companies, and we're excited to further enhance our collaboration. Today, we invite you to explore our new repository, HERE, – a hub of choice and compatibility, empowering you to select the Node.js version that suits your needs. But that's just the beginning of the story. If you are interested in our Enterprise version N|Solid it’s available to you for FREE with additional pricing packages for larger projects/teams and support.

Observability is vital, but it comes with computational overhead that shares the same infrastructure as your application. This is compounded in typical Node.js APM tooling due to the internal workings of Node.js itself. We are performance junkies at NodeSource, so observability without overhead was our first and foremost goal with the original architecture of the N|Solid Runtime. (Of course we didn’t stop there and also provide the deepest insights into your application.) With our new Cost Calculator, you can see just how much using the wrong APM tool can hurt. (WARNING: you may be shocked at the difference!). As you can see…the difference can be shocking. At NodeSource before anything else we’re Node.js developers. We were tired of being burnt ourselves by the additional overhead costs of observability and we kept seeing it over and over for our customers as well. So we decided to build and open source a benchmarking tool (*) to raise awareness of the issue. With it you can compare throughput and other differences between common Node.js observability tooling options. With the APM performance dashboard we can see just how much APMs impact application performance across a number of areas, and choosing incorrectly can reduce the potential throughput of your application by tens of thousands of requests per second. For more information about why this happens, check out this article by our VP of Engineering Adrián Estrada who provides a comprehensive analysis. 📗 Read the full blog post here: In-depth Analysis of the Performance Costs of APMs in Node.js. How to use the Node Observability Cost Calculator It's really easy to use, simply select an Observability Provider (Appdynamics, Datadog, Dynatrace, Instana, or New Relic), then your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP). From the Infrastructure Service dropdown you can select the service type and then choose from a list of options. Now enter the number of Processes you are monitoring, and see the savings! Why APM performance matters, beyond the cost savings Our Cost Calculator should quickly show you just how much you could save by using N|Solid over the competition without giving up observability. It’s easy to overlook the fact that your APM tooling is sharing the same processing time as your application and slowing it down. A big reason why developers and organizations love Node is for its performance, so why add overhead that slows it down? Why pay twice for observability? (BTW - OpenTelemetry adds significant overhead too, we included it in our benchmark) The great news is you don’t have to! Add N|solid to your stack today, and begin getting the best observability tooling (plus application security monitoring with NCM - Node Certified Modules) with the least overhead.

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, startups must prioritize these areas to build robust, scalable, and secure applications. This is where N|Solid can be a dynamic solution by providing powerful telemetry, insights, and security alerts for Node.js apps. This post will explore leveraging N|Solid effectively, a game-changer for startups, saving critical time and resources while serving customers with the best experience. We recently participated in Collision Conf in Toronto, where we met hundreds of startups who shared their bold ideas and solutions with the world. It’s why we wanted to put out this post, as we were asked over and over again about how we could help them save time, solve issues with their apps and level up their security. Startups are often focused on speed to market, meaning a lot of effort goes into delivering features to match the market needs they seek to meet. Teams can be limited in terms of the level of testing rigor and tooling that focuses on quality vs. completion. It can be a central component of an MVP strategy, but there are risks with this approach, notably with application performance and user experience. We have helped many startups elevate their approach by adding N|Solid into their development workflow. N|Solid is an AI-enabled APM (monitoring and management platform) and Security platform explicitly designed for Node.js applications. It offers various features that empower startups to optimize code performance, identify and troubleshoot issues, and deliver exceptional user experiences. With real-time insights and actionable data, N|Solid Console equips startups with the tools to make informed decisions and drive continuous improvement. “If you are using Node for anything important for your business, you should take a long, hard look at N|Solid” - Russ Whitman, CEO NodeSource N|Solid offers powerful debugging capabilities that enable developers to identify and rectify bottlenecks in production. With its built-in CPU profiling and heap snapshots, startups can quickly pinpoint performance hotspots and memory leaks, ensuring their applications run smoothly, even under high loads. By continuously monitoring performance metrics, startups can optimize their codebase, leading to faster and more responsive applications. They can also easily monitor and manage multiple instances of their applications, ensuring efficient load distribution and maximizing system resources. Understanding the Importance of Code Quality High-quality code forms the baseline of reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. Code quality matters significantly, particularly for startups, as it empowers them to have control over critical variables. Code quality also plays a vital role in the success of startups by providing a solid foundation for reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications that their users love. Poor code quality is very expensive. Performance issues can cost more than frustrated users; they add needless cloud spend and take the dev team away from feature development, trying to solve issues that are sometimes impossible to replicate in a dev or test environment. We have learned that teams often spend weeks, or even months, chasing bugs we could identify in minutes with N|Solid. That cost for a startup can be deadly. We recommend that all developers and DevOps add monitoring tooling into their development process because we see the positive impact of these solutions daily. There are many options, but if you are using Node.js, N|Ssolid is the tool you should be using. Other APM’s are great at providing a view into a range of technologies, but they can lack the depth of insights needed to pinpoint issues, especially with Node. Other APM’s monitor Node apps through instrumentation, and to gather metrics, they interrupt the event loop (killing performance). N|Solid doesn’t require instrumentation and doesn’t break the event loop. More importantly, it gathers the data other solutions don’t (like visibility into worker threads). Node is one of the most-loved technologies by developers because it's easy to wield; you can get up to speed quickly and build applications fast. But it's also relatively easy to build something in Node.js that has issues, especially the more complex the application is. Our Node experts have been helping developers access and leverage Node.js for nearly a decade - there is simply no better tool for Node.js than N|Solid. If your Startup uses Node, consider trying N|Solid.

They are a big part of our vision for the future of software development, one that is *, and AI - which was the topic of our talk. In this post we will share more about our vision and specifically how NodeSource is enabling that future. NodeSource began as most great companies do; with smart, passionate people that saw a problem they had to fix: there was simply no good tooling for Node.js. We were Node believers and open-source project contributors on a mission to make Node more accessible for developers & safe for enterprises to adopt. Since our beginning we have provided the ecosystem with our insights, training, and binary distributions of the open-source packages - over 110 million downloads in the last year alone - powering Node applications in production all over the globe. As a result of countless hours of ideating, coding and customer validation, N|Solid was born - an enterprise grade tool providing the deepest insights with the lowest overhead, all while continuing to keep ode apps secure. Today N|Solid is used by some of the largest organizations and developers globally. The mission that was set all those years ago is now more relevant than ever, over 30 million websites rely on Node.js and it’s one of the most used and loved technologies by developers worldwide. It's been an amazing journey. Revolutionizing Software Development: Advancing Telemetry, Security, and Efficiency with AI Innovation We have continued to innovate, with our Node experts pushing to create the most advanced telemetry and security platform possible while still providing customers with world class support for Node. We have always believed that giving the very foremost data and insights was the best way to produce better software. Making software is continually challenging; the software development life cycle (SDLC) is highly inefficient. You begin with an idea that you turn into code, then it gets built, tested and released for users to experience. Then you monitor for issues that are identified to triage and solve. Those fixes are added to other features to build, test, and release...and the cycle continues. While significant effort has been applied to make this process more efficient, these have invariably been small improvements. Tweaks really, to the overall process. Until now, fueled by the advancements in AI. We believe that the future of software is intelligent software engineering, * & AI. The SDLC is augmented by applying AI that is trained with the right data to accelerate the production and maintenance of secure, highly performant code. It’s about building a new model - a generative loop based upon the intent of the code and its actual operation in production - bringing data and AI into the process in powerful new ways. On the front end, AI is redefining the way code is written, from ChatGPT to GitHub’s CoPilot and beyond, Generative AI is creating code, documenting it, and writing test plans. These advancements are set to revolutionize the software development process on their own, replacing the often used copy/paste of code found from Google, StackOverflow, or existing codebases. Developers that leverage these new tools will have dynamically increased velocity of their code while still owning the solution. While significant, this is only a part of the solution of the future. Unveiling the True Measure of Software: Quality and Performance in Production The reality is that the quality and performance of software is only realized once it is in production, in use by real users. The telemetry data in this application is a key component for transforming the SDLC. How software performs in production, not how well software did in a test environment, is the true test for quality code. And the depth of that telemetry data is how you identify issues. This has long been our focus, not just to report on general metrics, but to go well beyond. This is why we established the measure of event loop utilization, worker thread monitoring, and more, to enable deep insights into application health and performance. Application health is directly tied to security, more than ever today quality code is secure code. But, security is not static, there are new vulnerabilities that develop all the time. The visibility to these is critical, especially for production code. It’s why we offer our security tooling, NCM (Node Certified Modules) as a part of our platform. Enabling customers to have visibility to security issues from development and production live code. It’s the depth of data and security health that unlock the opportunities with AI. It’s the other half of the equation of the future of software, * and AI. This is the future NodeSource is enabling. N|Solid - the future of Node bringing the power of data and AI With the announcement of our AI Assistant, “Adrian”, we are leveraging our unique and unparalleled data to help developers identify and resolve issues with tremendous speed and efficiency. Adrian will help every Node developer and devops engineer to not just view the telemetry, security, and alerts that matter - but to understand them, know their context and how to solve for them. It’s a game changer. It takes the power of the most advanced observability tool and the specific context of each application combined with our AI to resolve code issues fast. Furthermore, our AI tools will assess code quality, identify cost optimizations, generate code and more. It's like ‘god mode' for Node. This is the next step in our journey toward the future state of the SDLC.

    "text": "* Internet of Things Resources Blog Resources Partner Program Infrastructure Cost Company Contact Us About Press SIGN IN CONTACT US N|Solid Services Prici* You have re* Product N|Solid OSS Release by: Bryce Baril in Product on Oct 31 2023 NodeSource N|Solid Open Source Observability Node.js Share Origin of N|Solid In November of 2014, when NodeSource was still a small consulting group, my teammates Dan Shaw, Rod Vagg, and I were having dinner after a customer engagement, discussing how to bring Node.js production deployments to the same level of polish and tooling capability of the other runtimes our customers were already employing. The power and flexibility of Node.js helped it take off like a rocket, but the tooling to make sure that it was behaving properly had (and has) been a lot slower keeping up, or has used jury-rigged tooling designed for completely different runtime paradigms–effectively trying to shove a hexagonal peg into a square hole. There was a general lack of quality information, guidance, or practices around putting Node.js into production at all. Achieving this sort of parity and filling these holes in the community required solving simultaneous problems: fitting Node.js into modern production infrastructures, having reliable deployments and meaningful success metrics for expanding and internally evangelizing Node.js adoption, and even sometimes simply to just have any idea of what is going on in these Node.js production systems at all. Between our existing expertise with distributing Node.js builds and internal Node.js expertise itself we realized that if anyone was going to provide something like this for the Node.js Enterprise community, it would have to be us. We have always believed and seen firsthand that there is a giant number of teams and organizations that could benefit from an augmented set of tooling. Over the years, many of the people working on N|Solid were also core team members to the Node.js project, keeping an eye on industry needs often being deferred by the project. Foremost of these people is Trevor Norris, who has been our expert with his hands deepest in the V8 and Node C++ internals and continues to drive the vision and details of the N|Solid runtime. The broader community shares many of the same values when it comes to performance and the flexibility of Javascript and the power of the community and its resources such as npm–but we wanted to focus our attention and efforts to support the needs of those of us running important, secure, high-throughput, production environments. So we took it upon ourselves to tailor Node.js a business suit and help it work well with others. Part of what we came up with is what became N|Solid –an instrumented Node.js runtime and a purpose-built inspection console–a tool to both guide teams into a well-structured production environment as well as provide a devtools-like introspection and analysis interface to work with it. We wanted it to provide out-of-the-box compatibility for industry standard monitoring and other infrastructure tooling and harden its security profile, for example by disabling potentially unsafe features. Essentially, we wanted the ability to make decisions about the runtime that might make it less effective for small projects or experimental work in favor of a hardened runtime with guard rails, specifically designed to slot into best-practice production infrastructures. An example of this was the ability to override core Buffer allocation to zero-fill allocated memory. It took two more Node.js LTS releases after the initial N|Solid release with this feature for Node.js core to come up with an upstream permanent solution to the problem. We were able to provide protection for our clients immediately and seamlessly transition them to the upstream solution when it became available. The concept of N|Solid originated from our collective experience running Node.js applications in production and helping our customers with theirs. In addition, a good chunk of our business is helping people productionize and stabilize their Node.js environments, so we needed these tools in order to adequately research and analyze these customer issues. Much like any good product, its origin is building tools to solve our own problems first. The Challenge of Node.js Observability The fundamental nature of application performance is that everything going on in your code breaks down to CPU instructions and work that must be done. Instrumentation is also work, and the way it's implemented can be extremely contentious with your own business logic, especially on platforms such as Node.js that have single-threaded bottlenecks such as the V8 event loop. Without a separate agent thread like the N|Solid agent, at some point the event loop must stop doing application work to collect metrics, crunch numbers, and send them over the line to the monitoring endpoint. This is your only option if your instrumentation is written in JavaScript and runs on the same event loop as the application. N|Solid intentionally sequesters as much of this as possible to its own execution thread that works in parallel to Node.js. The work is still being done, but no longer in a way that is in contention with your own application for its single-threaded resources. This also enables us to detect and interact with a stuck Event Loop in a way that no other tool can. Every tool you add to your platform to improve observability and capture information adds additional overhead. N|Solid aims to provide a single, low-overhead agent for sharing this across all of your tooling needs in a way that is extremely tightly bound to the specifics of Node.js. Check out our benchmark tool to see how N|Solid compares when it comes to the cost of observability. The Technical Details Node.js is a small engine of amazingness; combining the V8 javascript engine with a core suite of libraries to provide an extremely fast and flexible runtime environment for javascript on the server. Developers generally approach runtime engines like little black boxes–as long as it runs their code the way they expect, what is actually going on doesn’t matter all that much. The reality is that the complexity around the asynchronous model Node.js uses being radically different from most other established platforms often results in confusion about what’s going on. Considering all of our goals around what data we needed access to for both introspection and hardening and the additional goal of near-zero contention with application performance, we decided the only solution would be to build our own version of the runtime with our additional changes patched in. This also allows users to use N|Solid by simply using the nsolid binary as if it was the node binary–because it is! To your application, N|Solid is an environment change only, and can be tried without changing a single line of your application code. There’s one small added complexity of doing it this way, though: we need to to make builds of N|Solid for every supported version of Node.js on every platform of node that our customers might require. This meant our changeset needed to be consistently applied across multiple changing upstream branches built on a build farm with every possible supported architecture. Fortunately, NodeSource was and remains the top community resource for making and distributing builds of Node.js – the odds are extremely good that if you’re using Node.js, we built it for you on the same servers we’re building N|Solid. The rough architecture of N|Solid is a native C++ thread and a matching Javascript module built into Node.js directly that can access internal hooks and has the ability to send the results upstream in a variety of ways, such as OpenTelemetry or StatsD. Foremost among these is the N|Solid Console which provides fully wired access to all of the runtime features by making use of the bi-directional N|Solid Agent API. This bi-directional communication layer with the agent thread is what enables something akin to devtools, allowing limited interaction with a live Node.js process–even one potentially running in production environments. It is vital that N|Solid retains 100% compatibility with Node.js, including the entire npm ecosystem. The community was and still is still seeing a significant amount of framework churn, we wanted to sit outside of the framework discussions because we understand just how many different frameworks are being used in production right now. We wanted to make sure we can support these frameworks in what they do, but also provide a tool for comparing and selecting between frameworks. We want N|Solid to play well with others, so we made it aware of community practices and standards, such as package.json and common Node.js environments. As the project adopts new features and standards, N|Solid also adapts. Our tooling is built around the runtime engine itself, treating each process (and potentially worker thread) as an individual unit, collecting a wide set of metrics and interactive introspection such as CPU profiling or Heap Snapshot collection from live processes without having stop them or start a canary process and hope that it reproduces the observable behavior. We found it essential to provide the ability to identify and inspect a suspect process while it is still alive, enabling you to interrogate the rogue process itself instead of the frustrating process of trying to reproduce the same behavior in a lab environment. Node applications are often large microservice installations, sharing state across potentially thousands of processes. We wanted the N|Solid Console to be a tool to expose the information to a central repository that could manage and inspect the results and let you do some limited interactive introspection remotely. This central location for your entire production installation lets you see everything at a glance, but still dig into the details of individual processes. This coordination aspect of the N|Solid Console also allows it to compare different processes–read more about anomaly detection and snapshot diffing in our documentation. N|Solid Features Robust APIs: Benefit from JavaScript and C++ APIs’ flexibility and power. Monitoring Data: N|Solid allows for the transmission of a wide array of monitoring data, encompassing system metrics, Event Loop Utilization, worker threads, and numerous specialized Node.js metrics to third-party providers such as Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace. Open Telemetry and Tracing: Send Open Telemetry compatible traces to supported third-party providers, ensuring comprehensive observability. StatsD Compatibility: Transmit monitoring information using StatsD to any compatible backend. Environment Variable Utilization: Use all available environment variables at runtime. Manual Control over CPU Profiles and Heap Snapshots: Gain the ability to manually capture CPU profiles and heap snapshots using the JS or C++ API. The N|Solid release schedule is tied directly to the Node.js LTS release schedule. Due to how flexible development on what’s called the Current Node.js line, we wait until the release as been solidified into its LTS form prior to creating a N|Solid version. This means that all active LTS lines of Node.js have a corresponding N|Solid Release, and we aim to release new versions of N|Solid within 24 hours of the upstream Node.js LTS release. If you are stuck on a legacy version of Node.js, let our support team help you update to a current LTS version to ensure you are still getting vital security patches. In summary, the N|Solid Runtime is the Node.js runtime, augmented with additional capabilities to enable what we saw as operational best practices. The N|Solid Console is the coordinated monitoring and introspection tool designed to fully leverage the N|Solid runtime and the combined experience of encountering and solving our own and our customer’s actual problems in production environments. Why Open Source the N|Solid Runtime? This is something we’ve considered for many years. We have always been a strong supporter of the community and believe in the immense value and impact of open-source. We have remained committed to the Node.js ecosystem as active contributors and being a leading distributor of the OSS binary packages. Earlier this year we came to the conclusion that the timing was right, our development roadmap had reached a point where we had something meaningful to provide to the community and we could continue to deliver the value and support our Enterprise and SaaS customers expect from our commercial offering. Further, we envision that the collaboration with the global developer community will create a brighter and more innovative future for N|Solid and set a new standard for enterprise needs. We think everyone should be running N|Solid on their business platforms where they are using Node.js. Throughout its existence, we’ve focused on compatibility with other production tooling–even those we compete with–because most of these are not tightly coupled to Node.js. Usually they are polyglot and must cater to the lowest commonality between platforms. We want to encourage the proliferation of N|Solid and the advancement of Node-paradigm specific tooling by putting the runtime directly into the hands of the Open Source community. We see an opportunity for developers to build new connectors and integrations with other tools and support the collective creativity of the community. We get the chance to foster even greater collaboration and partnerships with other providers that want to add the value of N|Solid to their own platforms and tools. We’re open source engineers at heart, we believe in the power of community code and that having the source available creates an environment of trust and empowerment. We feel like we’ve only been able to scratch the surface of what’s possible here and want to bring the community into the project and we hope that we can get you all excited about it too. Read more about how to get involved in our contribution guidelines! The Future of N|Solid We have a lot of plans already for N|Solid and welcome you to participate in their development. These are some of our upcoming initiatives: Custom Metrics: Capture and transport your own application-specific metrics via the N|Solid API Heap Profiling: Locate memory leaks by profiling memory allocation over time Async Stack Traces: Connect stack traces across the libuv boundary Improved APM Integrations: Allow APM vendors to use the N|Solid agent thread for metrics calculation and transport to move overhead off of the main process Implement OpenTelemetry standard for metrics Implement OpenTelemetry standard for logging These aren’t our only ideas, and we’re interested to see what the community comes up with as well. Expect to hear more about our plans as we continue work through the open source release and documentation process. There are so many potential valuable integrations throughout the development process from IDEs through CI/CD through production tooling–we can’t wait to see where we can take this together! Backed by the NodeSource Team N|Solid is backed by the entire NodeSource team, and for those who want a hand in adopting N|Solid or Node.js, we are here to help. From installation and configuration to upgrades, troubleshooting, and performance tuning, our engineers can support your team at every stage in the application development lifecycle.

Famous for being the largest European tech event (or even the world), Web Summit was full of riveting AI conversations, more than 2,600 startups, and plenty of tasty food trucks and, of course, amazing local cuisine.</p> <p>On the heels of this successful event, we’d like to share our team’s biggest event takeaways as we close this year on a strong note and get ready for what 2024 has in store. </p> <h2 id=\"1everyonehasauniquetakeonusingai\">#1 Everyone has a unique take on using AI.</h2> <p>From session topics to conversations with our peers, AI was all the buzz at the event and we were definitely not the only ones leaning into the AI movement. Startups across all industries are injecting AI into their products and services, and many are at different points in their adoption of the technology. While there are many who are only an inch deep into AI, some are using it in more advanced and compelling ways. </p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsemadeni/overlay/about-this-profile/\" title=\"Riccardo Semadeni\">Riccardo Semadeni</a>, MediRapp AG’s CEO, is transforming ultrasound diagnostics and improving global patient outcomes by automating everything from data collection to diagnosis to reporting. With AI, <a href=\"https://medirapp.ai/\" title=\"MediRapp\">MediRapp</a> is making the entire process faster, more accurate, and more effective while significantly elevating patient care. This is a great showcase of how AI can process nearly unlimited amounts of data and provide analysis that significantly increases the quality of outputs and helps make better decisions.</p> <p>On the other hand, another company, <a href=\"https://hiresmart.ai/\" title=\"Harry\">Harry</a>, is using AI in a completely different way. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/simoalamii/overlay/about-this-profile/\" title=\"Simo Alami\">Simo Alami</a> explained how they are creating AI powered resources for companies. Do you need a content writer? SEO specialist? PR manager? Other marketing talent? Harry will create a customized AI resource for your organization. This is a very interesting use of generative AI to create meaningful value for small and even large organizations by augmenting teams with AI powered by data.</p> <p>These two examples showcase how innovative leaders are identifying new ways to use AI advancements to transform their industries.</p> <h2 id=\"2collaborationpavesthewayforcontinuedtransformation\">#2 Collaboration paves the way for continued transformation.</h2> <p>Our team traveled from all over the world to attend Web Summit—Seoul, Madrid, Sao Paulo, Utah, Seattle, Medellin, Bogata, Vancouver, and Berlin. With this in-person time together, we dove deep into ways we could continue to elevate our offering and customer experience. We discussed ways to evolve our recently open-sourced N|Solid Runtime and advance our AI powered <a */nsolid-copilot-release\" title=\"N|Solid CoPilot\">Node.js Copilot</a>, which we released on the first day of Web Summit. This time allowed us to gather essential insights from our community who shared the common consensus that NodeSource’s ability to open-source our runtime would be transformative for development teams. </p> <p>Having dedicated time to come together as a team to bond, share, and test new ideas is critical to our success and we look forward to putting these plans into motion.</p> <h2 id=\"3ourindustryisfullofstartupfoundersdedicatedtomakinganimpact\">#3 Our industry is full of startup founders dedicated to making an impact.</h2> <p>On the event’s opening day, NodeSource was one of 300 startups selected for a special event, “The Gathering.” During the day, we participated in group sessions discussing a range of topics from leadership to raising capital to AI. While these discussions were full of great insights, what was even more notable was the ability to connect with fellow founders looking to make an impact.</p> <p>Web Summit was full of lively conversation about taking our industry to the next level. We chatted with startup entrepreneurs, learned from headliners with unique stories, and shared exciting updates with investors, press, and customers. We thoroughly enjoyed connecting with founders and enterprise leaders whose digital products rely on Node.js and tech builders that leverage and build with Node.</p> <p>Overall, NodeSource had a wonderful time at Web Summit and even had the opportunity to visit some local sites, like visiting CasCais by way of a winding trek along the coast and then up into the hills to the westernmost point of all of Europe at Cabo Da Roca. Heading into the new year, we can’t wait to attend Web Summit 2024!</p> ]]> </*[ * ]]> </title> <description> <![CDATA[ Explore JSConf Colombia's dynamic 10th anniversary, supported by NodeSource.

The power and flexibility of Node.js helped it take off like a rocket, but the tooling to make sure that it was behaving properly had (and has) been a lot slower keeping up, or has used jury-rigged tooling designed for completely different runtime paradigms–effectively trying to shove a hexagonal peg into a square hole. There was a general lack of quality information, guidance, or practices around putting Node.js into production at all. </p> <p>Achieving this sort of parity and filling these holes in the community required solving simultaneous problems: fitting Node.js into modern production infrastructures, having reliable deployments and meaningful success metrics for expanding and internally evangelizing Node.js adoption, and even sometimes simply to just have any idea of what is going on in these Node.js production systems at all.</p> <p>Between our existing expertise with distributing Node.js builds and internal Node.js expertise itself we realized that if anyone was going to provide something like this for the Node.js Enterprise community, it would have to be us. </p> <p>We have always believed and seen firsthand that there is a giant number of teams and organizations that could benefit from an augmented set of tooling. Over the years, many of the people working on N|Solid were also core team members to the Node.js project, keeping an eye on industry needs often being deferred by the project. Foremost of these people is Trevor Norris, who has been our expert with his hands deepest in the V8 and Node C++ internals and continues to drive the vision and details of the N|Solid runtime. The broader community shares many of the same values when it comes to performance and the flexibility of Javascript and the power of the community and its resources such as npm–but we wanted to focus our attention and efforts to support the needs of those of us running important, secure, high-throughput, production environments.</p> <p>So we took it upon ourselves to tailor Node.js a business suit and help it work well with others. Part of what we came up with is what became <a href=\"https://n*|Solid\">N|Solid</a> –an instrumented Node.js runtime and a purpose-built inspection console–a tool to both guide teams into a well-structured production environment as well as provide a devtools-like introspection and analysis interface to work with it. We wanted it to provide out-of-the-box compatibility for industry standard monitoring and other infrastructure tooling and harden its security profile, for example by disabling potentially unsafe features. Essentially, we wanted the ability to make decisions about the runtime that might make it less effective for small projects or experimental work in favor of a hardened runtime with guard rails, specifically designed to slot into best-practice production infrastructures.</p> <p>An example of this was the ability to override core <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#static-method-bufferallocsize-fill-encoding\" title=\"buffer allocation\">Buffer allocation</a> to zero-fill allocated memory. It took two more Node.js LTS releases after the initial N|Solid release with this feature for Node.js core to come up with an upstream permanent solution to the problem. We were able to provide protection for our clients immediately and seamlessly transition them to the upstream solution when it became available.</p> <p>The concept of N|Solid originated from our collective experience running Node.js applications in production and helping our customers with theirs. In addition, a good chunk of our business is helping people productionize and stabilize their Node.js environments, so we needed these tools in order to adequately research and analyze these customer issues. Much like any good product, its origin is building tools to solve our own problems first.</p> <h2 id=\"thechallengeofnodejsobservability\">The Challenge of Node.js Observability</h2> <p>The fundamental nature of application performance is that everything going on in your code breaks down to CPU instructions and work that must be done. Instrumentation is also work, and the way it's implemented can be extremely contentious with your own business logic, especially on platforms such as Node.js that have single-threaded bottlenecks such as the V8 event loop. Without a separate agent thread like the N|Solid agent, at some point the event loop must stop doing application work to collect metrics, crunch numbers, and send them over the line to the monitoring endpoint. This is your only option if your instrumentation is written in JavaScript and runs on the same event loop as the application.</p> <p>N|Solid intentionally sequesters as much of this as possible to its own execution thread that works in parallel to Node.js. The work is still being done, but no longer in a way that is in contention with your own application for its single-threaded resources. This also enables us to <a href=\"*#ncm2-nsolid-integration\" title=\"detect and interact with a stuck Event loop\">detect and interact with a stuck Event Loop</a> in a way that no other tool can.</p> <p>Every tool you add to your platform to improve observability and capture information adds additional overhead. N|Solid aims to provide a single, low-overhead agent for sharing this across all of your tooling needs in a way that is extremely tightly bound to the specifics of Node.js.</p> <p>Check out our <a href=\"*/?runId=1682468927429\" title=\"benchmark tool\">benchmark tool</a> to see how N|Solid compares when it comes to the cost of observability.</p> <h2 id=\"thetechnicaldetails\">The Technical Details</h2> <p>Node.js is a small engine of amazingness; combining the V8 javascript engine with a core suite of libraries to provide an extremely fast and flexible runtime environment for javascript on the server. Developers generally approach runtime engines like little black boxes–as long as it runs their code the way they expect, what is actually going on doesn’t matter all that much. The reality is that the complexity around the asynchronous model Node.js uses being radically different from most other established platforms often results in confusion about what’s going on.</p> <p>Considering all of our goals around what data we needed access to for both introspection and hardening and the additional goal of near-zero contention with application performance, we decided the only solution would be to build our own version of the runtime with our additional changes patched in. This also allows users to use N|Solid by simply using the <code>nsolid</code> binary as if it was the <code>node</code> binary–because it is! To your application, N|Solid is an environment change only, and can be tried without changing a single line of your application code.</p> <p>There’s one small added complexity of doing it this way, though: we need to to make builds of N|Solid for every supported version of Node.js on every platform of node that our customers might require. This meant our changeset needed to be consistently applied across multiple changing upstream branches built on a build farm with every possible supported architecture. Fortunately, NodeSource was and remains the top community resource for making and <*/distributions\" title=\"distributing builds of Node.js\">distributing builds of Node.js</a> – the odds are extremely good that if you’re using Node.js, we built it for you on the same servers we’re building N|Solid.</p> <p>The rough architecture of N|Solid is a native C++ thread and a matching Javascript module built into Node.js directly that can access internal hooks and has the ability to send the results upstream in a variety of ways, such as <a href=\"*#opentelemetry\" title=\"OpenTelemetry\">OpenTelemetry</a> or <a href=\"*#statsd\" title=\"StatsD\">StatsD</a>. Foremost among these is the <a href=\"https://n*|Solid Console\">N|Solid Console</a> which provides fully wired access to all of the runtime features by making use of the bi-directional N|Solid Agent API. This bi-directional communication layer with the agent thread is what enables something akin to devtools, allowing limited interaction with a live Node.js process–even one potentially running in production environments.</p> <p>It is vital that N|Solid retains 100% compatibility with Node.js, including the entire npm ecosystem. The community was and still is still seeing a significant amount of framework churn, we wanted to sit outside of the framework discussions because we understand just how many different frameworks are being used in production right now. We wanted to make sure we can support these frameworks in what they do, but also provide a tool for comparing and selecting between frameworks.</p> <p>We want N|Solid to play well with others, so we made it aware of community practices and standards, such as package.json and common Node.js environments. As the project adopts new features and standards, N|Solid also adapts.</p> <p>Our tooling is built around the runtime engine itself, treating each process (and potentially worker thread) as an individual unit, collecting a wide set of metrics and interactive introspection such as CPU profiling or Heap Snapshot collection from live processes without having stop them or start a canary process and hope that it reproduces the observable behavior. We found it essential to provide the ability to identify and inspect a suspect process while it is still alive, enabling you to interrogate the rogue process itself instead of the frustrating process of trying to reproduce the same behavior in a lab environment.</p> <p>Node applications are often large microservice installations, sharing state across potentially thousands of processes. We wanted the N|Solid Console to be a tool to expose the information to a central repository that could manage and inspect the results and let you do some limited interactive introspection remotely. This central location for your entire production installation lets you see everything at a glance, but still dig into the details of individual processes. This coordination aspect of the N|Solid Console also allows it to compare different processes–read more about <a href=\"*#cpu-anomaly-detection\" title=\"anomaly detection \">anomaly detection</a> and <a href=\"*#saved-views\" title=\"snapshot diffing\">snapshot diffing</a> in our documentation.</p> <p>N|Solid Features</p> <ul> <li>Robust APIs: Benefit from JavaScript and C++ APIs’ flexibility and power.</li> <li>Monitoring Data: N|Solid allows for the transmission of a wide array of monitoring data, encompassing system metrics, Event Loop Utilization, worker threads, and numerous specialized Node.js metrics to third-party providers such as Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace.</li> <li>Open Telemetry and Tracing: Send Open Telemetry compatible traces to supported third-party providers, ensuring comprehensive observability.</li> <li>StatsD Compatibility: Transmit monitoring information using StatsD to any compatible backend.</li> <li>Environment Variable Utilization: Use all available environment variables at runtime.</li> <li>Manual Control over CPU Profiles and Heap Snapshots: Gain the ability to manually capture CPU profiles and heap snapshots using the JS or C++ API.</li> </ul> <p>The N|Solid release schedule is tied directly to the Node.js LTS release schedule. Due to how flexible development on what’s called the Current Node.js line, we wait until the release as been solidified into its LTS form prior to creating a N|Solid version. This means that all active LTS lines of Node.js have a corresponding N|Solid Release, and we aim to release new versions of N|Solid within 24 hours of the upstream Node.js LTS release. If you are stuck on a legacy version of Node.js, let our support team help you update to a current LTS version to ensure you are still getting vital security patches.</p> <p>In summary, the N|Solid Runtime <strong>is</strong> the Node.js runtime, augmented with additional capabilities to enable what we saw as operational best practices. The <a href=\"https://n*|Solid Console\">N|Solid Console</a> is the coordinated monitoring and introspection tool designed to fully leverage the N|Solid runtime and the combined experience of encountering and solving our own and our customer’s actual problems in production environments.</p> <h2 id=\"whyopensourcethensolidruntime\">Why Open Source the N|Solid Runtime?</h2> <p>This is something we’ve considered for many years. We have always been a strong supporter of the community and believe in the immense value and impact of open-source. We have remained committed to the Node.js ecosystem as active contributors and being a leading distributor of the OSS <a */advancing-nodejs-package-repo-23\" title=\"binary packages\">binary packages</a>. </p> <p>Earlier this year we came to the conclusion that the timing was right, our development roadmap had reached a point where we had something meaningful to provide to the community and we could continue to deliver the value and support our Enterprise and SaaS customers expect from our commercial offering. Further, we envision that the collaboration with the global developer community will create a brighter and more innovative future for N|Solid and set a new standard for enterprise needs.</p> <p>We think everyone should be running N|Solid on their business platforms where they are using Node.js. Throughout its existence, we’ve focused on compatibility with other production tooling–even those we compete with–because most of these are not tightly coupled to Node.js. Usually they are polyglot and must cater to the lowest commonality between platforms. We want to encourage the proliferation of N|Solid and the advancement of Node-paradigm specific tooling by putting the runtime directly into the hands of the Open Source community. We see an opportunity for developers to build new connectors and integrations with other tools and support the collective creativity of the community. We get the chance to foster even greater collaboration and partnerships with other providers that want to add the value of N|Solid to their own platforms and tools.</p> <p>We’re open source engineers at heart, we believe in the power of community code and that having the source available creates an environment of trust and empowerment. We feel like we’ve only been able to scratch the surface of what’s possible here and want to bring the community into the project and we hope that we can get you all excited about it too.</p> <p>Read more about how to get involved in our <*/nsolid/blob/node-v20.x-nsolid-v5.x/CONTRIBUTING.md\" title=\"contribution guidelines\">contribution guidelines</a>!</p> <h2 id=\"thefutureofnsolid\">The Future of N|Solid</h2> <p>We have a lot of plans already for N|Solid and welcome you to participate in their development.

Observability is vital, but it comes with computational overhead that shares the same infrastructure as your application. This is compounded in typical Node.js APM tooling due to the internal workings of Node.js itself. We are performance junkies at NodeSource, so observability without overhead was our first and foremost goal with the original architecture of the N|Solid Runtime. (Of course we didn’t stop there and also provide the deepest insights into your application.) With our new Cost Calculator, you can see just how much using the wrong APM tool can hurt. (WARNING: you may be shocked at the difference!).</p> <*pa5cvq/1lFmjc0fAH9CFMksA7eTqm/19eb33a9a674e7c33de6b5c843644d54/results.png\" alt=\"See How Much Your APM is Costing You to Monitor Node.js Apps\"></p> <p>As you can see…the difference can be shocking. At NodeSource before anything else we’re Node.js developers. We were tired of being burnt ourselves by the additional overhead costs of observability and we kept seeing it over and over for our customers as well. So we decided to build and open source a benchmarking tool (<a href=\"*\">*</a>) to raise awareness of the issue. With it you can compare throughput and other differences between common Node.js observability tooling options.</p> <*pa5cvq/5mmA0t4ueKrwNNxHMrqwzU/7985be6e4cf1bd58334e4649df506071/apmdash.png\" alt=\"See How Much Your APM is Costing You to Monitor Node.js Apps\"></p> <p>With the APM performance dashboard we can see just how much APMs impact application performance across a number of areas, and choosing incorrectly can reduce the potential throughput of your application by tens of thousands of requests per second.

With the growth of organizations leveraging serverless increasing as they realize the performance and cost benefits, we're excited to provide customers with this new visibility into the health and performance of their Node.js apps utilizing Serverless Functions utilizing serverless architectures.</p> <*pa5cvq/40A5oBL2oaLGSX9EXWIvki/ed5ad1f7675d4111fa78323d4970fd22/Serverless-NSolid-Feature.png\" alt=\"*\"> <strong>Img 1. Serverless Cloud Providers</strong></p> <p>Observability has become a critical part of software development; understanding performance issues and why they occur is incredibly valuable. Leveraging Serverless introduces challenges for observability based on how the technology works due to added complexity and challenges in data collection and analysis. Some key observability issues include:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Cold starts:</strong> When a serverless function is first invoked, it takes time for the underlying infrastructure to spin up. This can lead to latency issues, especially for applications that require a high degree of responsiveness. In other words, Lambda must initialize a new container to execute the code, and that initialization takes time.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Debugging:</strong> Debugging serverless applications can be challenging due to the event-driven nature of the platform. This is because it can be difficult to track the flow of execution through an application comprising multiple functions invoked in response to events.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Visibility:</strong> Serverless providers typically provide limited visibility into the underlying infrastructure. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot performance issues and identify security vulnerabilities.</p></li> </ul> <p>N|Solid now makes it easy to implement <strong>distributed tracing</strong> based on __OpenTelemetry__, providing better insights into these microservices-based systems.</p> <h2 id=\"whatisserverless\">What is Serverless?</h2> <p>Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Instead, developers pay for the resources they use, such as the time their code runs and the amount of data it stores.</p> <p>Some key benefits of Serverless Computing include:</p> <ul> <li>Accelerated app development,</li> <li>Reduced costs and improved scalability,</li> <li>Increased agility</li> </ul> <p>Serverless computing has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering several advantages over traditional server-based architectures. However, serverless computing can also be complex, and observability, monitoring, and debugging can be particularly challenging. </p> <p>Key concepts to understand the importance of extending observability to serverless architectures:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Observability:</strong> The ability to understand the state of a system by collecting and analyzing telemetry data. This data can include logs, metrics, and traces. Traces are a particularly important type of telemetry data, as they can be used to track the flow of requests through a system.</p></li> <li><p><strong>OpenTelemetry:</strong> An open-source observability framework that can collect and analyze telemetry data from various sources. It includes support for __Distributed Tracing__, which can be used to track the flow of requests through a serverless environment.</p></li> </ul> <p>At NodeSource, we have been at the forefront of supporting developers to solve these challenges in their Node.js applications, so we have extended this series of features and content since last year:</p> <ul> <li>Distributed Tracing Support in N|Solid - <a href=\"https://nsrc.io/DistributedTracingNS\" title=\"Distributed Tracing Support in N|Solid\">https://nsrc.io/DistributedTracingNS</a></li> <li>Enhance Observability with Opentelemetry Tracing - Part 1 - <a href=\"https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel1\" title=\"Enhance Observability with Opentelemetry Tracing\">https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel1</a></li> <li>Instrument your Node.js Applications with Open Source Tools - Part 2 - <a href=\"https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel2\" title=\"Instrument your Nodejs Applications with Open Source Tools \">https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel2</a></li> <li>AIOps Observability: Going Beyond Traditional APM - <a href=\"https://nsrc.io/AIOpsNSolid\" title=\"AIOps Observability: Going Beyond Traditional APM\">https://nsrc.io/AIOpsNSolid</a></li> </ul> <p>In a serverless environment, applications are typically composed of several different services, each responsible for a specific task. This can make it difficult to track the flow of requests through the system and identify performance problems, but not with N|Solid:</p> <blockquote> <p>With this release, you can now have traces of when a microservices system calls a serverless function. </p> </blockquote> <p>Now, with N|Solid, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Track the flow of requests across your microservices architecture, from the Frontend to the Backend.</li> <li>Identify performance bottlenecks and errors.</li> <li>Correlate traces across multiple services.</li> <li>Visualize your traces in a timeline graph.</li> </ul> <p>N|Solid is a <a href=\"*/\" title=\"Benchmark NodeSource\">lightweight</a> and performance-oriented tracing solution that can be used with any Node.js application. It is easy to install and configure, and it does not require any changes to your code.</p> <h2 id=\"introducingserverlesssupportforawslambda\">Introducing Serverless Support for AWS Lambda</h2> <p>NodeSource has introduced a new observability feature to gather information throughout a request in a serverless environment. The collected information can be used for debugging latency issues, service monitoring, and more. This is valuable for users interested in debugging request latency in a serverless environment. </p> <*pa5cvq/1HMJFDMMMq9c2OpPhNuS6U/3f9ac9fe45f77856d05e6411788de694/Img1-wizard-installation.png\" alt=\"*\"></p> <p><strong>Img 2.

This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques, including:</p> <ul> <li>__Metrics__: Metrics are data points that measure the performance of an application, such as the number of requests per second, the average response time, and the amount of memory used.</li> <li>__Logs__: Logs are records of events in an application, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages.</li> <li>__Traces__: Traces are records of a request's path through an application, including the time it spends in each function.</li> </ul> <p>By collecting and analyzing this data, serverless monitoring tools can identify performance problems, such as:</p> <ul> <li>__Cold starts__: Cold starts is when a serverless function is invoked for the first time. This can cause a delay in the response time.</li> <li>__Overcrowding__: Overcrowding occurs when too many requests are sent to a serverless function simultaneously. This can cause the function to slow down or crash.</li> <li>__Bottlenecks__: Bottlenecks occur when a particular part of an application is slow. Some factors, such as inefficient code, a lack of resources, or a bug, can cause this.</li> </ul> <p>Once a performance problem has been identified, serverless monitoring tools can help developers fix the problem. This can be done by:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tuning the application:</strong> Developers can tune the application by changing the code, configuration, or resources used.</li> <li><strong>Evolving the application:</strong> Developers can evolve it by adding new features or changing how it works.</li> <li><strong>Monitoring the application:</strong> Developers can continue monitoring the application to ensure that the problem has been fixed and the application performs as expected.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"benefitsofnsolidimplementingserverless\">Benefits of N|Solid Implementing Serverless</h2> <*pa5cvq/6yNSmGixggG0OLmE3VunuA/2c7e7697a2770169ca89cc018e826a70/Img5-_FunctionDashboard.png\" alt=\"*\"></p> <p><strong>Img 5.

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, startups must prioritize these areas to build robust, scalable, and secure applications. This is where N|Solid can be a dynamic solution by providing powerful telemetry, insights, and security alerts for Node.js apps. This post will explore leveraging <a href=\"https://n*|Solid Product Page\">N|Solid</a> effectively, a game-changer for startups, saving critical time and resources while serving customers with the best experience.</p> <*pa5cvq/3nsRCQ054XPdqsVXjHmll4/af7f99c6cef4c67e679d9dcc12e3f220/Collision-Pic-NodeSource.jpg\" alt=\"*\"></p> <p>We recently participated in <a href=\"https://collisionconf.com/\" title=\"CollisionConf\">Collision Conf</a> in Toronto, where we met hundreds of startups who shared their bold ideas and solutions with the world. It’s why we wanted to put out this post, as we were asked over and over again about how we could help them save time, solve issues with their apps and level up their security. </p> <p>Startups are often focused on speed to market, meaning a lot of effort goes into delivering features to match the market needs they seek to meet. Teams can be limited in terms of the level of testing rigor and tooling that focuses on quality vs. completion. It can be a central component of an MVP strategy, but there are risks with this approach, notably with application performance and user experience. We have helped many startups elevate their approach by adding <a href=\"https://n*|Solid\">N|Solid</a> into their development workflow. </p> <*pa5cvq/f0b6TUn64yLgRzbcnLha8/ea12c0a0269001a284d2dea82b24e7e8/NSolid-Console-AI-Assistant.png\" alt=\"*\"></p> <p>N|Solid is an AI-enabled APM (monitoring and management platform) and Security platform explicitly designed for Node.js applications.

Code quality matters significantly, particularly for startups, as it empowers them to have control over critical variables. Code quality also plays a vital role in the success of startups by providing a solid foundation for reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications that their users love. </p> <p>Poor code quality is very expensive. Performance issues can cost more than frustrated users; they add needless cloud spend and take the dev team away from feature development, trying to solve issues that are sometimes impossible to replicate in a dev or test environment. We have learned that teams often spend weeks, or even months, chasing bugs we could identify in minutes with N|Solid. That cost for a startup can be deadly. </p> <p>We recommend that all developers and DevOps add monitoring tooling into their development process because we see the positive impact of these solutions daily. There are many options, but if you are using Node.js, N|Ssolid is the tool you should be using. Other APM’s are great at providing a view into a range of technologies, but they can lack the depth of insights needed to pinpoint issues, especially with Node. Other APM’s monitor Node apps through instrumentation, and to gather metrics, they interrupt the event loop (killing performance). N|Solid doesn’t require instrumentation and doesn’t break the event loop. More importantly, it gathers the data other solutions don’t (like visibility into <a href=\"https://nsrc.io/WorkerThreadsNS\" title=\"Worker Threads\">worker threads</a>).</p> <p>Node is one of the most-loved technologies by developers because it's easy to wield; you can get up to speed quickly and build applications fast. But it's also relatively easy to build something in Node.js that has issues, especially the more complex the application is. Our Node experts have been helping developers access and leverage Node.js for nearly a decade - there is simply no better tool for Node.js than N|Solid.

They are a big part of our vision for the future of software development, one that is *, and AI - which was the topic of our talk. In this post we will share more about our vision and specifically how NodeSource is enabling that future.</p> <*pa5cvq/5dxskEUOcTn9OaMwbKetKk/622b8b7aaf389dfe03a107ae6bab9121/NodeSource-CollisionConf.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to *: *\"></p> <p>NodeSource began as most great companies do; with smart, passionate people that saw a problem they had to fix: there was simply no good tooling for Node.js. We were Node believers and open-source project contributors on a mission to make Node more accessible for developers &amp; safe for enterprises to adopt. Since our beginning we have provided the ecosystem with our insights, training, and <a */node-by-numbers-2021-2022/\" title=\"binary distributions\">binary distributions</a> of the open-source packages - over 110 million downloads in the last year alone - powering Node applications in production all over the globe.</p> <p>As a result of countless hours of ideating, coding and customer validation, <a href=\"https://n*|Solid\">N|Solid</a> was born - an enterprise grade tool providing the deepest insights with the lowest overhead, all while continuing to keep ode apps secure. Today N|Solid is used by some of the largest organizations and developers globally. The mission that was set all those years ago is now more relevant than ever, over 30 million websites rely on Node.js and it’s one of the most used and loved technologies by developers worldwide. It's been an amazing journey. </p> <h2 id=\"revolutionizingsoftwaredevelopmentadvancingtelemetrysecurityandefficiencywithaiinnovation\">Revolutionizing Software Development: Advancing Telemetry, Security, and Efficiency with AI Innovation</h2> <p>We have continued to innovate, with our Node experts pushing to create the most advanced telemetry and security platform possible while still providing customers with world class support for Node. We have always believed that giving the very foremost data and insights was the best way to produce better software. Making software is continually challenging; the software development life cycle (SDLC) is highly inefficient.</p> <*pa5cvq/7g5V2HwZJxXisqrGGIY9RS/d3c4f87d5b2bb46c52fcf3ebf7beaed6/img-SoftwareDevelopment-Lifecycle.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to *: *\"></p> <p>You begin with an idea that you turn into code, then it gets built, tested and released for users to experience. Then you monitor for issues that are identified to triage and solve. Those fixes are added to other features to build, test, and release...and the cycle continues. While significant effort has been applied to make this process more efficient, these have invariably been small improvements. Tweaks really, to the overall process. Until now, fueled by the advancements in AI. </p> <p>We believe that the future of software is intelligent software engineering, * &amp; AI. The SDLC is augmented by applying AI that is trained with the right data to accelerate the production and maintenance of secure, highly performant code. It’s about building a new model - a generative loop based upon the intent of the code and its actual operation in production - bringing data and AI into the process in powerful new ways. </p> <p>On the front end, AI is redefining the way code is written, from ChatGPT to GitHub’s CoPilot and beyond, Generative AI is creating code, documenting it, and writing test plans. These advancements are set to revolutionize the software development process on their own, replacing the often used copy/paste of code found from Google, StackOverflow, or existing codebases. Developers that leverage these new tools will have dynamically increased velocity of their code while still owning the solution. While significant, this is only a part of the solution of the future. </p> <h2 id=\"unveilingthetruemeasureofsoftwarequalityandperformanceinproduction\">Unveiling the True Measure of Software: Quality and Performance in Production</h2> <p>The reality is that the quality and performance of software is only realized once it is in production, in use by real users. The telemetry data in this application is a key component for transforming the SDLC. How software performs in production, not how well software did in a test environment, is the true test for quality code. And the depth of that telemetry data is how you identify issues. This has long been our focus, not just to report on general metrics, but to go well beyond. This is why we established the measure of event loop utilization, worker thread monitoring, and more, to enable deep insights into application health and performance. </p> <p>Application health is directly tied to security, more than ever today quality code is secure code. But, security is not static, there are new vulnerabilities that develop all the time. The visibility to these is critical, especially for production code. It’s why we offer our security tooling, <*/ncmv2/docs\" title=\"NCM (Node Certified Modules)\">NCM (Node Certified Modules)</a> as a part of our platform. Enabling customers to have visibility to security issues from development and production live code. </p> <p>It’s the depth of data and security health that unlock the opportunities with AI. It’s the other half of the equation of the future of software, * and AI. This is the future NodeSource is enabling.</p> <h2 id=\"nsolidthefutureofnodebringingthepowerofdataandai\">N|Solid - the future of Node bringing the power of data and AI</h2> <p>With the <a */*\" title=\"announcement of our AI Assistant, “Adrian”\">announcement of our AI Assistant, “Adrian”</a>, we are leveraging our unique and unparalleled data to help developers identify and resolve issues with tremendous speed and efficiency.

    "text": "* Internet of Things Resources Blog Resources Partner Program Infrastructure Cost Company Contact Us About Press SIGN IN CONTACT US N|Solid Services Prici* You have re* Product * by: Marian Villa in Product on Aug 03 2023 N|Solid for AWS Lambda AWS Lambda Cloud Release Brief AWS N|Solid Share We are excited to release Serverless Observability for N|Solid with support for AWS Lambda. With the growth of organizations leveraging serverless increasing as they realize the performance and cost benefits, we're excited to provide customers with this new visibility into the health and performance of their Node.js apps utilizing Serverless Functions utilizing serverless architectures. Img 1. Serverless Cloud Providers Observability has become a critical part of software development; understanding performance issues and why they occur is incredibly valuable. Leveraging Serverless introduces challenges for observability based on how the technology works due to added complexity and challenges in data collection and analysis. Some key observability issues include: Cold starts: When a serverless function is first invoked, it takes time for the underlying infrastructure to spin up. This can lead to latency issues, especially for applications that require a high degree of responsiveness. In other words, Lambda must initialize a new container to execute the code, and that initialization takes time. Debugging: Debugging serverless applications can be challenging due to the event-driven nature of the platform. This is because it can be difficult to track the flow of execution through an application comprising multiple functions invoked in response to events. Visibility: Serverless providers typically provide limited visibility into the underlying infrastructure. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot performance issues and identify security vulnerabilities. N|Solid now makes it easy to implement distributed tracing based on OpenTelemetry, providing better insights into these microservices-based systems. What is Serverless? Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Instead, developers pay for the resources they use, such as the time their code runs and the amount of data it stores. Some key benefits of Serverless Computing include: Accelerated app development, Reduced costs and improved scalability, Increased agility Serverless computing has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering several advantages over traditional server-based architectures. However, serverless computing can also be complex, and observability, monitoring, and debugging can be particularly challenging. Key concepts to understand the importance of extending observability to serverless architectures: Observability: The ability to understand the state of a system by collecting and analyzing telemetry data. This data can include logs, metrics, and traces. Traces are a particularly important type of telemetry data, as they can be used to track the flow of requests through a system. OpenTelemetry: An open-source observability framework that can collect and analyze telemetry data from various sources. It includes support for Distributed Tracing, which can be used to track the flow of requests through a serverless environment. At NodeSource, we have been at the forefront of supporting developers to solve these challenges in their Node.js applications, so we have extended this series of features and content since last year: Distributed Tracing Support in N|Solid - https://nsrc.io/DistributedTracingNS Enhance Observability with Opentelemetry Tracing - Part 1 - https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel1 Instrument your Node.js Applications with Open Source Tools - Part 2 - https://nsrc.io/NodeJS_OTel2 AIOps Observability: Going Beyond Traditional APM - https://nsrc.io/AIOpsNSolid In a serverless environment, applications are typically composed of several different services, each responsible for a specific task. This can make it difficult to track the flow of requests through the system and identify performance problems, but not with N|Solid: With this release, you can now have traces of when a microservices system calls a serverless function. Now, with N|Solid, you can: Track the flow of requests across your microservices architecture, from the Frontend to the Backend. Identify performance bottlenecks and errors. Correlate traces across multiple services. Visualize your traces in a timeline graph. N|Solid is a lightweight and performance-oriented tracing solution that can be used with any Node.js application. It is easy to install and configure, and it does not require any changes to your code. Introducing Serverless Support for AWS Lambda NodeSource has introduced a new observability feature to gather information throughout a request in a serverless environment. The collected information can be used for debugging latency issues, service monitoring, and more. This is valuable for users interested in debugging request latency in a serverless environment. Img 2. N|Solid Serverless Installation Process With this announcement, we are enabling the opportunity to connect a process following the indications of our Wizard. You will be able to connect the traces of your Node application through requests or connected functions, by connecting the data, you will be able to find the cause of latency issues, errors, and other problems in serverless environments. How to apply Serverless Observability through N|Solid: Key practices include leveraging distributed tracing to understand end-to-end request flows, instrumenting functions with custom metrics, analyzing logs for debugging and troubleshooting, and employing centralized observability platforms for comprehensive visibility. Img 3. N|Solid Serverless Configuration To use loading Opentelemetry Instrumentation Modules, first, use the NSOLID_INSTRUMENTATION environment variable to specify and load the Opentelemetry instrumentation modules you want to utilize within your application. To enable instrumentation for specific modules, follow these steps: For HTTP requests using the http module, set the NSOLID_INSTRUMENTATION environment variable to http. If you're also performing PostgreSQL queries using the pg module, include it in the NSOLID_INSTRUMENTATION environment variable like this: http,pg. List all the relevant instrumentation modules required for your application. This will enable the tracing and monitoring of the specified modules, providing valuable insights into their performance and behavior. Connect through integration the serverless functions; select and configure the environment variable you require. For more advanced settings, visit our NodeSource documentation. Img 4. N|Solid Wizard Installation Summary In our NodeSource documentation, you will find CLI - Implementation and Instructions or directly follow the instructions of our Wizard: Install Usage Interactive Shell Inline Inputs Interactive Inputs Help Uninstall Benefits of N|Solid Implementing Serverless Serverless monitoring collects and analyzes serverless application data to identify and fix performance problems. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques, including: Metrics: Metrics are data points that measure the performance of an application, such as the number of requests per second, the average response time, and the amount of memory used. Logs: Logs are records of events in an application, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages. Traces: Traces are records of a request's path through an application, including the time it spends in each function. By collecting and analyzing this data, serverless monitoring tools can identify performance problems, such as: Cold starts: Cold starts is when a serverless function is invoked for the first time. This can cause a delay in the response time. Overcrowding: Overcrowding occurs when too many requests are sent to a serverless function simultaneously. This can cause the function to slow down or crash. Bottlenecks: Bottlenecks occur when a particular part of an application is slow. Some factors, such as inefficient code, a lack of resources, or a bug, can cause this. Once a performance problem has been identified, serverless monitoring tools can help developers fix the problem. This can be done by: Tuning the application: Developers can tune the application by changing the code, configuration, or resources used. Evolving the application: Developers can evolve it by adding new features or changing how it works. Monitoring the application: Developers can continue monitoring the application to ensure that the problem has been fixed and the application performs as expected. Benefits of N|Solid Implementing Serverless Img 5. N|Solid Functions Dashboard Now, directly in your N|Solid Console, you’ll have the Function Dashboard, which will allow you to review in-depth and detail all the functions you have connected. By selecting the functions, you can access the Function Detail View. Img 6. N|Solid Function Detail View In the first content block, you will have the following: The function's name and the provider's icon. Note: If you click on the function itself, it will open the function itself in a new tab directly in AWS. On the other hand, in the central box, you will have: - RUNTIME VERSION - FUNCTION VERSION - ACCOUNT ID - N|Solid LAYER: (It is versioned, which is what allows us to see the AWS info) - REGIONS: The zone of the function. Where it is running that specific version. - ARCHITECTURE: Lambda can have several Linux architectures. This info comes directly from AWS. And finally, on the right corner of our console, we will have Vulnerability Status, and below this, Estimated Cost: How much are you spending on this function? For more information, please review our documentation. About N|Solid Layer In an AWS Lambda, you can have information about hundreds of instances, AWS does it for you, but you don't have information on each invocation. They show you by default the last 5 minutes through the median, the 99th percentile, etc., but they can't give us invocation by invocation individually; they simply group them. There are two types of data we have from AWS Lambda: Real-Time Metrics or Telemetry API Metrics Cloudwatch Metrics The metrics that CloudWatch reports are not real-time. They are extracted from the CloudWatch API by the Lambda Metrics Forwarder and displayed as AWS Lambda delivers them directly. This means there may be a delay of up to a few minutes between recording and displaying a metric. The Telemetry API Metrics, which we extract, through Lambda layers, through modules that we install to your function to be executed. We distributed this information as a layer,N|Solid Layer, injecting code inside. An AWS extension for N|Solid provides information about the life cycle of each Lambda function providing data to the console: Generate the Timeline Graph Span: Span Details, Path of the Span, and filter the results by attributes of the Span. Changing Time Range Generate SBOM reports Our method tracks where the function is frozen to optimize Lambda resources within certain limits, allowing access to the information even after the function has been frozen.🤯In real-time, the registration is detected, providing the key information on each invocation in each instance. In Closing, We've been working on serverless observability for our customers for a while because we believe in the value of leveraging the technology approach. Serverless provides many benefits for developers and teams, but it can be difficult to provide quality observability without adding a lot of expensive overhead. N|Solid can now help teams develop and maintain better software, resolve issues faster, and provide security for both traditional and serverless Node.js Applications.

    "text": "* Internet of Things Resources Blog Resources Partner Program Infrastructure Cost Company Contact Us About Press SIGN IN CONTACT US N|Solid Services Prici* You have re* Community * by: Russ Whitman in Community on Nov 30 2023 NodeSource Conference Artificial Intelligence Recap Share Along with approximately 70,000 other souls from around the globe, the NodeSource team attended Web Summit 2023 earlier this month. Famous for being the largest European tech event (or even the world), Web Summit was full of riveting AI conversations, more than 2,600 startups, and plenty of tasty food trucks and, of course, amazing local cuisine. On the heels of this successful event, we’d like to share our team’s biggest event takeaways as we close this year on a strong note and get ready for what 2024 has in store. #1 Everyone has a unique take on using AI. From session topics to conversations with our peers, AI was all the buzz at the event and we were definitely not the only ones leaning into the AI movement. Startups across all industries are injecting AI into their products and services, and many are at different points in their adoption of the technology. While there are many who are only an inch deep into AI, some are using it in more advanced and compelling ways. For example, Riccardo Semadeni, MediRapp AG’s CEO, is transforming ultrasound diagnostics and improving global patient outcomes by automating everything from data collection to diagnosis to reporting. With AI, MediRapp is making the entire process faster, more accurate, and more effective while significantly elevating patient care. This is a great showcase of how AI can process nearly unlimited amounts of data and provide analysis that significantly increases the quality of outputs and helps make better decisions. On the other hand, another company, Harry, is using AI in a completely different way. Simo Alami explained how they are creating AI powered resources for companies. Do you need a content writer? SEO specialist? PR manager? Other marketing talent? Harry will create a customized AI resource for your organization. This is a very interesting use of generative AI to create meaningful value for small and even large organizations by augmenting teams with AI powered by data. These two examples showcase how innovative leaders are identifying new ways to use AI advancements to transform their industries. #2 Collaboration paves the way for continued transformation. Our team traveled from all over the world to attend Web Summit—Seoul, Madrid, Sao Paulo, Utah, Seattle, Medellin, Bogata, Vancouver, and Berlin. With this in-person time together, we dove deep into ways we could continue to elevate our offering and customer experience. We discussed ways to evolve our recently open-sourced N|Solid Runtime and advance our AI powered Node.js Copilot, which we released on the first day of Web Summit. This time allowed us to gather essential insights from our community who shared the common consensus that NodeSource’s ability to open-source our runtime would be transformative for development teams. Having dedicated time to come together as a team to bond, share, and test new ideas is critical to our success and we look forward to putting these plans into motion. #3 Our industry is full of startup founders dedicated to making an impact. On the event’s opening day, NodeSource was one of 300 startups selected for a special event, “The Gathering.” During the day, we participated in group sessions discussing a range of topics from leadership to raising capital to AI. While these discussions were full of great insights, what was even more notable was the ability to connect with fellow founders looking to make an impact. Web Summit was full of lively conversation about taking our industry to the next level. We chatted with startup entrepreneurs, learned from headliners with unique stories, and shared exciting updates with investors, press, and customers. We thoroughly enjoyed connecting with founders and enterprise leaders whose digital products rely on Node.js and tech builders that leverage and build with Node. Overall, NodeSource had a wonderful time at Web Summit and even had the opportunity to visit some local sites, like visiting CasCais by way of a winding trek along the coast and then up into the hills to the westernmost point of all of Europe at Cabo Da Roca. Heading into the new year, we can’t wait to attend Web Summit 2024!

This privacy statement (“Policy”) explains what kinds of information we collect and how Interactive Insights strives to collect, use and disclose information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business. This Policy applies to our data platform (“Platform”) and our associated services (“Service(s)”) as well as our websites located at http://www.interactiveinsights.io/, https://www.contextlink.io/, http://www.predictive-inc.com/, and https://nodesource.com/ (our “Websites”). PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR WEBSITES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS * (PII) Interactive Insights collects * (“PII”) from its Websites when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on the Websites. Interactive Insights uses this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry Non-* Interactive Insights also collects Non-* (“Non-PII”) from visitors to the Websites. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system. In some places, such as the European Economic Area, certain Non-PII such as cookie IDs and IP addresses are considered personal data. Cookies and other Tracking Technologies Interactive Insights and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Websites, and track users’ movements around the Websites. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. For more information about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising from those partners, click here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads. Third Party Websites The Interactive Insights Websites may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from Interactive Insights’ policies. While the company endeavors to associate only with reputable entities, Interactive Insights cannot guarantee the privacy practices of other websites will reflect ours; we encourage you to check the privacy policies of all websites that you visit. PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR PLATFORM AND SERVICES Overview of Interactive Insights’ connectivity Services The Interactive Insights Connectivity and Context Services include data onboarding, linking, and distribution to companies and many of the players in the digital advertising industry to enable smarter targeting with more relevant messages and more accurate measurement. Onboarding is a service that loads 1st, 2nd and 3rd party data into the digital ecosystem (Customer Data Platform (CDP)), so it can be used for digital advertising purposes. The players include advertisers wishing to reach consumers, advertising supported websites, advertising supported apps, email marketing services, and addressable TV channels. Today consumers interact with advertisers and brands through a variety of channels – offline and digital. This cross channel interaction is known as “omni channel.” Interactive Insights services are used to support these interactions for several types of entities in the digital advertising industry, including: Consumer Brands, Companies that enable the delivery of advertising and marketing messages, and Companies that provide consumer data and insights to brands to help them better understand their current and prospective customers. Brands are interested in understanding consumers anywhere: while online, while watching television, while using their mobile devices and virtually everywhere their customers are making purchasing decisions. All that requires lots of data. And Interactive Insights helps brands connect that data in order to help them make intelligent decisions. PII and Digital Identifiers uses on the Platform across channels Due to technical differences across the channels, Interactive Insights uses different approaches tailored specifically to each channel to provide our Connectivity Services. The common basis of these services is an ID that Interactive Insights assigns to an individual. The ID may be used in a personally identifiable state or in a manner that is not used to identify the individual, depending on the channel and the use. ​Interactive Insights collects certain types of information in connection with our Connectivity Services. This includes personal data such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number if permitted by our partners and clients through policy notices they have provided to consumers. We also collect other data such as IP address, mobile device ID, and browser and operating system type and version. In addition, we handle, process, and share this data with our marketing platform partners in the course of performing our services; however we do not retain or use this data for our own internal business purposes unless permitted by our clients. Interactive Insights Cookie-based Connectivity Services Connectivity Services for cookie-based integrations are based on a Interactive Insights ID and a Interactive Insights cookie that together identify a browser. The cookie containing the ID is set when a consumer clicks on a offer, reward, or survey, visits the website of one of our cookie match partners as a registered user, or when a consumer opens certain emails from a cookie match partner. Because match partners know the consumer, they enable Interactive Insights to recognize the consumer as well and set the Interactive Insights cookie containing the appropriate ID.​ For example, our match partners may enable us to place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device, and our match partners may share personal data with us, such as your name, postal address, or email address. Interactive Insights uses the personal data to link an ID to information stored in LiveRamp, and add context to the profile. We also may collect information such as the device’s IP address and browser or operating systems type and version. We use this information to recognize consumers and add context across different channels and platforms over time for the purposes of facilitating online advertising, analytics, attribution, fraud detection, and reporting purposes. For cookie-based integrations, three types of connections are maintained. The first is the connection between Interactive Insights cookies and marketing platform partner cookies, a sync that enables Interactive Insights to distribute advertising data to partners on behalf of our clients. In this case, the Interactive Insights cookies containing Interactive Insights IDs are synced with cookies set by our marketing platform partners.​ The second connection is between Interactive Insights cookies and LiveRamp and/or third-party data providers. In this case, LiveRamp and/or third party data providers onboard their data and Interactive Insights matches it to the appropriate Interactive Insights IDs, thereby connecting the data to the correct Interactive Insights cookie.​ Finally, the third connection is between a brand’s data and the Interactive Insights graph. When marketers onboard their data, Interactive Insights associates the brand’s data with the Interactive Insights ID, thus connecting this data to the LiveRamp cookies. Once all these connections are made, a marketer can use them to understand the context and relationship between their customers to run offers, rewards, surveys, ad's or email marketing campaigns perform and deliver ads or offline marketing to specific individuals when they visit a website with ad inventory. For example, we may facilitate the delivery of an ad to an individual in his or her web browser based on a purchase he or she made in a physical retail store, or we may enable a brand to send a personalized marketing email to that individual based on the fact that he or she visited a particular website.​ Interactive Insights cookies are set with an RLCDN.com name and expire from Interactive Insights’s system after 90 days unless they are renewed or refreshed. Unlike web “tracking” cookies, Interactive Insights cookies do not “track” users’ behavior across websites. Instead, Interactive Insights cookies are used to recognize an individual so that relevant ads and email marketing can be delivered to the intended recipient. Interactive Insights Mobile Connectivity Services Connectivity Services for mobile ID integrations are similar to cookie integrations except they use the mobile advertising ID assigned to the device instead of a cookie – namely the Apple ID for Advertising (IDFA) and the Android Advertising ID (AAID). We associate the Interactive Insights ID with the mobile ID just like we would associate the cookie. Interactive Insights links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to mobile devices through the Interactive Insights ID. Mobile advertising IDs do not expire like cookies. Instead the device gives the user the ability to change the ID at any time, thus breaking the connection between the old ID and the device. Consistent with our online policy, Interactive Insights IDs are used to recognize individuals so relevant ads and offline marketing can be delivered and campaigns can be measured. ​Interactive Insights Addressable TV Connectivity Services: Connectivity Services for addressable TV integrations are similar to online and mobile services except they use the subscriber ID assigned by the carrier to the set-top box instead of a cookie or a mobile ID. We associate the Interactive Insights ID with the subscriber ID just like we would associate the cookie or mobile ID. Interactive Insights links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to subscriber IDs through the Interactive Insights ID. ​Addressable TV subscriber IDs do not expire like cookies. Instead the carrier gives the user the ability to determine if they wish to see targeted advertising on their TV. Consistent with our online and mobile policy, Interactive Insights IDs are used only to recognize individuals so relevant ads can be delivered and campaigns can be measured. Pseudonymization Processes: Interactive Insights may recognize an online, mobile or addressable TV user in two ways. First when our match partner shares personal data with us, or second when they share other information with us that is not used to identify individuals. When they share personal data, we can recognize a consumer on an identifiable basis. However, to preserve user privacy, we create a unique Interactive Insights ID when we combine it with other anonymous data. Interactive Insights values the preservation of consumer privacy, designing its systems and services to treat personal data and other information that is not used to identify individuals with utmost care. Interactive Insights chooses the appropriate Interactive Insights ID, either personal data or de-identified, based on the services it has been asked to perform; it does not mingle the two in any way that compromises user protections or choice. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES Updating and Deleting Your Information Upon request, and as required under applicable law, Interactive Insights will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your data. If you’d like to update, correct, delete, port or deactivate any data that you have provided to the company on the Websites or otherwise via our business operations, please send your request to privacy@interactiveinsights.com, and Interactive Insights will process your request. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe – for data subjects located in the EU, that time frame will be 30 days and Interactive Insights will honor such requests as they pertain to personal data. Choice Mechanisms Interactive Insights wants to make sure you are informed of the privacy choices that are available to you. We require that our partners meet the same high standards we have. We contractually require that our match partners employ notice and choice mechanisms, and we work with other information service providers and our partners to assist them in following their respective industry standards. While we only process data as directed by our clients with respect to the Platform and Services, we believe the following information may be helpful. Opt-out from Interest Based Advertising from third-party companies - Many of our partners that enable targeted advertising are members of one or more digital advertising industry self-regulatory programs. You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and European Digital Advertising Alliance (“eDAA”) opt-out tools to learn more about targeted or interest-based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs. http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices http://www.aboutads.info/choices http://youronlinechoices.com Mobile Application Choices - Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings. Generally when advertising companies are able to detect that a user of a device has opted out via their mobile operating system, such companies won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device. Interactive Insights doesn’t generally engage in the types of behaviors that would subject us to choice requirements via our Platform or Services. However, our clients may engage in such behaviors. As a result, we’ve configured our systems to recognize, manage and store signals from choice mechanisms in multiple channels so that our customers may take action (or refrain from taking action) in response to such signals. Privacy Shield Interactive Insights complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Interactive Insights has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Interactive Insights is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data transferred to the United States under Privacy Shield, should direct their query to privacy@interactiveinsights.com. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to privacy@interactiveinsights.com. Onward Transfer of Personal Data Interactive Insights may share data with trusted agents, including PII. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for Interactive Insights. In the EU, such companies are sometimes called “data processors.” Interactive Insights may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Interactive Insights may also disclose your information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Finally, Interactive Insights may transfer information, including any personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Interactive Insights is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a notice on our Websites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data. In the context of an onward transfer, Interactive Insights is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Interactive Insights shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Interactive Insights proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Data Retention The data we store on the Platform and utilize as part of our Services is non-sensitive personal data and not subject to any sector specific data retention requirements. We retain data on the Platform as directed by our clients and strongly encourage our clients to retain data only for as long as is reasonably necessary. The data collected via our Websites and our internal business operations is retained for up to 13 months after our last interaction with a particular data subject unless such data is required to be held longer under applicable law. Interactive Insights cookies are set with an RLCDN.com name and expire from Interactive Insights’ system after 90 days unless they are renewed or refreshed. Data Integrity, Purpose Limitation We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use as described above. ENFORCEMENT Privacy Complaints by EU and Swiss Individuals In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, Interactive Insights commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. Persons located in the European Union or Switzerland who have inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us at privacy@interactiveinsights.com. We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.

Changes To This Privacy Policy This Policy may be amended from time to time, consistent with the requirements of the Privacy Shield Principles and other privacy requirements.

Get Started Today A microservices architecture (including APIs and SOA) structures applications as a collection of loosely-coupled services which enable numerous granular business capabilities. In addition to making continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications possible, microservices also enable efficient evolution of an organization’s technology stack. For organizations in many industries — from financial services to interactive gaming and media — Node.js is especially useful in allowing applications to talk to each other via APIs for increased operational and business success. Download the Data Sheet Financial services Many forward-thinking financial services companies strive to add value over traditional banks, adopting new technologies and delivering services through user-friendly digital channels. Node.js offers a lightweight, event-driven model ideal for building APIs that allow applications to talk to each other. Though eager for competitive advantage, financial services businesses remain risk averse, with all the compliance, security, and privacy concerns that go along with managing customers’ money. If just one application is unavailable for a single minute, millions could be lost. These “million-dollar-a-minute” apps require serious security and failure predictability, as well as the ability to quickly triage and correct any outages or issues as they arise. Gaming and media If gamers lose the ability to make in-game purchases or a game goes down, primary revenue streams are interrupted, and the user experience is diminished. Interactive online games are common targets for hackers, so security is paramount. Media companies distribute content to partners and customers online, and often their entire businesses are on the web. If they can’t provide the content, they lose revenue. Node.js with NodeSource For modern organizations, Node.js is a tremendously popular technology choice it’s easy to use and rarely breaks. But when a problem does arise, it can be a difficult to understand immediately what went wrong, where, and how to fix it. When moving from development to production, DevOps teams often struggle to understand how to monitor and predict problems with Node.js.. NodeSource provides visibility into application behavior and overall system health, so you can understand what’s going on in your code more than you can with Node.js alone. NodeSource can help you find the root cause of performance issues, identify what broke, and where to go within the code to fix it — saving days or months of work, and potentially millions of dollars in revenue. N|Solid for API & microservices Microservice processes are ephemeral; because they are, short-lived and frequently changing, capturing forensic data can be a challenge, especially in regards to CPU profiling or memory snapshots — the very things that provide insight into application performance. It’s possible to get those artifacts with Node.js and other open source products, but the unique challenges of transferring information about memory or crashing problems in order to examine them poses security challenges. Further, OS instrumentation and augmentation of scripts can present security risks, have adverse effects, and provide imprecise results. N|Solid removes all these friction points and makes profiling, capturing snapshots, or troubleshooting event-loop lag simple and painless. Its architecture allows ephemeral artifacts to be moved to a stable, user-determined location. Even if the process goes down, the artifacts remain, long after a crash or machine termination. If a process in production is completely blocked and insight into a non-responsive application is required, there is no solution in the open source world. Because the NodeSource agent lives inside the event loop, it can retrieve that critical information. Further, the system uses encryption, cryptographic keys and curves, and is a complement to any protocol. Rigorous development processes help, as does testing in a staging environment, but production is where the heavy loads, unique use cases and long tail anomalies occur. Some patterns will only occur in a production environment. Visibility, insight and post-mortem debuggability are essential in triaging and resolving problems quickly and effectively. NodeSource saves time, money, and resources in finding and fixing a bug that, if left unresolved, could take out internal business processes, applications, or APIs, negatively impacting customers or partners. Key Considerations How NodeSource Provides Value Protecting critical data and services N|Solid ships with configurable security policies to help harden your applications. Always-on vulnerability scanning makes you aware of emerging risks in real time, not just at runtime. Fast and reliable performance for end users N|Solid provides tools for profiling application performance and supports workflows that give the entire team insight into behavior. Compliance with regulatory and self-imposed standards NodeSource Certified Modules provides license enforcement and quantitative trust in third-party Node.js modules, empowering developers to use open source code with minimal overhead while ensuring compliance and mitigating risk. Ability to rapidly detect and remediate issues and reduce or eliminate outages Customizable alerts give your team instant notice when a problem is detected, enabling remediation of issues before they escalate to a full-scale outage and reducing mean time-to-resolution (MTTR).

Get Started Today Applications with sustained high-volume workloads, various transaction sizes, and other I/O-intensive environments are prevalent across a broad swath of industries and businesses. Medical sciences and imaging, aerospace, online transaction processing, weather forecast and simulation, data migration, and video — both on-demand and post-production processing — are just a few examples of the diversity of data and transaction-heavy use cases. These high-performance environments can involve massive or minimal requirements for data storage, but they always have active workloads with either a large number of transactions of various sizes, or a smaller number of transactions that require high bandwidth of many megabytes per second. Optimizing for these varied environments is not straightforward, and often a challenge. Download the Data Sheet Node.js with NodeSource For many organizations with high-traffic environments, Node.js is tremendously useful — it’s ideal for I/O-bound applications due to its single-thread event loop and asynchronous processing. For typical Node.js applications, a majority of processing time is spent waiting for network, file system, and database transactions to complete. Node.js is an elegant solution for handling high request volumes thanks to its asynchronous I/O methods, which allow simultaneous requests to be served during the time it takes for a read/write to complete. Although Node.js is an excellent technology choice for this use case, there is only so much an application can do under continuous tremendous load, so visibility into the performance and health of these applications is critical. Most high I/O use cases develop scalability issues, so ensuring this visibility is critical to detecting and resolving issues before they cause a major system failure or outage. The solution to scaling gracefully may be to create more instances of an application, distributing across multiple Node.js processes, or other changes to architecture, without insight into the behavior of an application, it’s nearly impossible for teams to identify and implement the best case-specific solution. NodeSource provides visibility into application behavior and overall system health with performance metrics not captured by the open source Node.js runtime, offering your team an unparalleled view of how code behaves in a production environment. By capturing detailed Node.js-specific metrics, the N|Solid platform can help you find the root cause of performance issues, identify what broke, and where to go within the code to fix it — saving days or months of work and drastically improving time to resolution. N|Solid for High-Performance N|Solid provides critical insight in cases where performance is critical by providing metrics on event loop lag, and task-per- second performance monitoring. It also provides critical metrics on open and active handlers — connections to transaction-related tasks — that provide valuable data to inform when and how to scale out infrastructure or services, pinpoint memory leakages, and when to free up resources. N|Solid removes common friction points and makes it safe and simple to monitor and protect production applications. Make rapid incremental changes, debug issues faster, and make better architectural decisions with the ability to see performance degradation or problems as code continues to change. Customers have saved weeks of troubleshooting performance regressions, high latency, and other issues. By using the N|Solid in high volume environments, teams can stay ahead of potential scalability problems, memory, and resource management issues, ultimately driving savings on infrastructure costs as well as potential outages in production. Maximizing the value of Node.js Applications performance monitoring tools can provide insight into services, applications and infrastructure, but at a very high level, and without visibility into the inner workings of Node.js. However, watching from the outside actually impacts the performance of the event loops, providing inaccurate data. Because the N|Solid runtime agent lives natively at the core of your application, it can capture highly detailed, Node.js-specific data with a negligible impact on performance. Watching from the inside out also delivers more metrics because it operates alongside — not above — your applications. Rigorous development processes help, as does testing in a staging environment, but production is where the heavy loads, unique use cases, and long tail anomalies occur. Some patterns will only occur in a production environment. Visibility, insight, and post-mortem debuggability are essential in triaging and resolving problems quickly and effectively. NodeSource saves time, money, and resources in finding and fixing bugs that, if left unresolved, could threaten the success of legacy migration projects.

NodeSource provides visibility into application behavior and overall system health with performance metrics not captured by the open source Node.js runtime, offering your team an unparalleled view of how code behaves in a production environment. By capturing detailed Node.js-specific metrics, the N|Solid platform can help you find the root cause of performance issues, identify what broke, and where to go within the code to fix it — saving days or months of work and drastically improving time to resolution. N|Solid for High-Performance N|Solid provides critical insight in cases where performance is critical by providing metrics on event loop lag, and task-per- second performance monitoring. It also provides critical metrics on open and active handlers — connections to transaction-related tasks — that provide valuable data to inform when and how to scale out infrastructure or services, pinpoint memory leakages, and when to free up resources. N|Solid removes common friction points and makes it safe and simple to monitor and protect production applications. Make rapid incremental changes, debug issues faster, and make better architectural decisions with the ability to see performance degradation or problems as code continues to change. Customers have saved weeks of troubleshooting performance regressions, high latency, and other issues. By using the N|Solid in high volume environments, teams can stay ahead of potential scalability problems, memory, and resource management issues, ultimately driving savings on infrastructure costs as well as potential outages in production. Maximizing the value of Node.js Applications performance monitoring tools can provide insight into services, applications and infrastructure, but at a very high level, and without visibility into the inner workings of Node.js. However, watching from the outside actually impacts the performance of the event loops, providing inaccurate data. Because the N|Solid runtime agent lives natively at the core of your application, it can capture highly detailed, Node.js-specific data with a negligible impact on performance. Watching from the inside out also delivers more metrics because it operates alongside — not above — your applications. Rigorous development processes help, as does testing in a staging environment, but production is where the heavy loads, unique use cases, and long tail anomalies occur. Some patterns will only occur in a production environment. Visibility, insight, and post-mortem debuggability are essential in triaging and resolving problems quickly and effectively. NodeSource saves time, money, and resources in finding and fixing bugs that, if left unresolved, could threaten the success of legacy migration projects. Key Considerations How NodeSource Provides Value Protecting critical data and services N|Solid ships with configurable security policies to help harden your applications. Always-on vulnerability scanning makes you aware of emerging risks in real-time, not just at runtime. Fast and reliable performance for end users N|Solid provides tools for profiling application performance and supports workflows that give the entire team insight into behavior Relevant, Node.js-specific metrics The N|Solid runtime agent lives natively at the application core, where it captures highly detailed, Node.js-specific metrics with greater accuracy than popular APM tools and negligible impact on performance.

Get Started Today From home and business security, industrial equipment and healthcare, to air travel, insurance and entertainment, the Internet of Things has spread rapidly across business sectors. Node.js is especially useful in IoT as this field continues to grow in popularity. Anytime a user has endpoints running Node.js in the field — whether it be in chipset or a kiosk/device — they need to ensure their apps are running, and doing so effectively. Collecting all that endpoint data effectively, and being able to repurpose it as well - is critical for the success of IoT implementations. Traditionally, it’s been hard to debug hardware. Writing software that enables hardware to \"phone home\" to web-based services can be especially tricky. Node.js is being adopted in IoT use cases for rapidly prototyping before products get hardened and mass produced. However, troubleshooting open source Node.js by itself in a debugging environment or as part of quality assurance can be difficult, if not impossible. Download the Data Sheet Node.js with NodeSource For many IoT companies and situations, Node.js is tremendously popular - it’s easy to use and rarely breaks. But when a problem does arise, understanding what went wrong, where, and how to fix it is very hard to do; whenever possible, eliminating these bugs before devices are mass produced is critical. When moving from prototype to production, when developers need to monitor and predict problems with Node.js, there is no simple solution. However, with NodeSource, you can understand what’s going on in your code more than you can with Node.js alone. NodeSource can help you find the root cause of performance issues, identify what broke, and where to go within the code to fix it - saving days, or even months of work. N|Solid for IoT The N|Solid platform is especially helpful in IoT use cases because of how the protocol works. It moves code data away from the individual device (which might have limited storage or availability, or may not be secure) out to cloud-based, user-determined and controlled storage. In the case of quality assurance uses, developers can debug and get greater visibility into processes during product bake-in, a huge value add and tremendous resource saver. For example, capturing forensic data can be a challenge, especially in regards to CPU profiling or memory snapshots; the very things that provide insight into application performance. It’s possible to get those artifacts with Node.js and other open source products, but the unique challenges of transferring information about memory or crashing problems in order to examine them poses security challenges. Further, open source instrumentation and augmentation of scripts can present security risks, have adverse effects, or provide imprecise results. NodeSource N|Solid removes all these friction points and makes things like profiling, snapshots or troubleshooting event-loop lag safe and simple. It’s architecture allows ephemeral artifacts to be moved to a stable, user determined location. Even if the the process goes down, the artifacts remain long after a crash or device termination. If a process in production is completely blocked and insight into a non-responsive application is required, there is no solution in the open source world. Because the NodeSource agent lives inside the event-loop it can retrieve that critical information. Further, the system uses encryption, crypto keys and curves, and is a complement to any protocol. Rigorous development processes help, as does testing in a staging environment, but production is where the heavy loads, unique use cases and long tail anomalies occur--some patterns will only occur in a production environment. Visibility, insight and post-mortem debuggability are essential in triaging and resolving problems quickly and effectively. NodeSource saves time, money and resources in finding and fixing a bug that could take out internal business processes, applications, or APIs that are affecting customers or partners.

Get Started Today The need to modernize legacy applications is becoming increasingly common. Twenty- to thirty- year-old legacy systems are relied upon by banks, government agencies, and other businesses to perform essential customer and business transactions. These systems are often custom-built, include millions of lines of code, and support data-intensive processes. They are central to business, containing critical data and vital intellectual property. Most of these aging systems aren't able to keep up with ever-increasing demands, especially those that manage large amounts of data and high transaction rates. As a result, leaders across industries and departments, from IT to the C-suite, are worried about threats to mission-critical capabilities, security breaches, performance issues, and service disruptions. Over the years, efforts to keep up with technology changes meant old, slow-performing and resource-intensive systems were incrementally updated over time. But the resulting accumulated technical debt — or the cost of additional work caused by years of selecting a simple solution in the short term rather than a more complex, long term approach — is massive. The answer for many organizations is legacy application migration and modernization on new platforms for improved resource optimization, higher scalability, faster data speed and quicker workload balancing — in-house or in the cloud. Download the Data Sheet Node.js with NodeSource For many organizations faced with legacy migration, Node.js is a tremendously useful development framework — it’s easy to use and rarely breaks. It also promotes a decoupling of the architecture paradigm, enabling rapid iteration and reduced risk. The patterns that Node.js introduces into the development environment are broken into smaller pieces which allows for code with disposability, and the option of more aggressive and flexible development. If something breaks, developers don’t need to address the whole code base. But problems can arise with many smaller pieces of code, and it can be a difficult to immediately understand what went wrong, where, and how to fix it. Third-party packages from the open source community can help speed the development cycle, but using them can introduce a new set of quality control issues. NodeSource provides visibility into application behavior and overall system health, so you can understand what’s going on in your code more than you can with Node.js alone. The N|Solid platform can help you find the root cause of performance issues, identify what broke, and where to go within the code to fix it, saving days or months of work. Additionally NodeSource Certified Modules is a secure, private registry of trusted Node modules. NCM calculates a trust score for each public third-party module, monitoring for security vulnerabilities and dynamically adjusting scores in real time to identify emerging risks. Armed with an understanding of a module’s risk profile, users can confidently install third-party modules in mission-critical environments. N|Solid for Legacy Migration N|Solid removes common friction points and makes it safe and simple to monitor and protect production applications.

It's not an LTS release (that happens in October) or intended for your production servers yet, but 10.x takes some vital steps forward to help Node continue to grow, so get testing on it ASAP. The Official Node 10 Release Post — This is essentially just a changelog and links to the release downloads, so if you want to learn more about what Node 10 is above, keep scrolling.

SENCHA SPONSOR Some more on what's new in Node 10: It uses V8 6.6 which improves `Function.prototype.toString()`, caches code after execution, compiles bytecode on a background thread, offer async performance improvements for promises, Arrays, and more. the N-API 'Native API' is now stable/non-experimental - this makes it easier to build native addons that can target Node generally rather than have to worry about V8 or version concerns, and essentially Node core can become 'neutral' to the engine behind it - more here. there's also a Node-Chakracore release that uses Microsoft's JavaScript engine instead of V8 The Buffer constructor has been deprecated (mostly) It adopts of standardized 'error codes' OpenSSL 1.1 support - which means TLS 1.3 support soon Experimental promisified versions of `fs` functions in `fs/promises` Node 10 supports lots of new regex features HTTP/2 support, which will continue to be extended as 10.x progresses We can now use async iteration natively It comes with npm 5.6, but 6.0 is available if you want to try it (see below) npm@6 Announced: Another Major Update to npm — npm 6.0 isn’t included with Node 10 yet, but you can play with it today. Beyond the usual performance improvements (up to 17x faster than npm a year ago), npm 6 focuses heavily on security and soon “every user of the npm Registry will begin receiving automatic warnings if you try to use code with a known security issue.” A new npm audit command will also soon let you recursively analyze dependencies for security issues.
