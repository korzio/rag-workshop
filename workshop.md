## Workshop Blueprint Explanation

I've created a comprehensive codebase that covers all the sections of your workshop. Here's how the code is organized and can be used throughout the workshop:

### 1. First call to LLM (10 min) - @pavlik
The code includes:
- A basic OpenAI API call function
- A simple interactive chat implementation
- A LangChain example showing conversation memory

This demonstrates the fundamental ways to interact with an LLM and how LangChain can simplify these interactions.

### 2. Document Retrieval (5 min) - @alex
The code provides functions for:
- Loading JSON documents
- Loading CSV files
- Fetching and parsing RSS feeds (simulated)

These functions show different document sources you can use in a RAG system.

### 3. Document Splitting (15 min) - @alex
Several text splitting strategies are implemented:
- Character-based splitting
- Token-based splitting
- Paragraph-based splitting
- Sentence-based splitting

There's also a demo function showing how each strategy affects the resulting chunks for comparison.

### 4. Document Storage (30 min) - @alex
The code covers:
- Generating embeddings using OpenAI
- A simple in-memory vector store with cosine similarity search
- SQLite integration for document storage
- ChromaDB integration for vector storage

This demonstrates both DIY approaches and purpose-built vector databases.

### 5. Retrieve & Summarize (10 min) - @pavlik
Functions for:
- Basic RAG implementation
- Document summarization
- Advanced RAG with more context handling

Plus a complete end-to-end workflow example that ties all sections together.

## Workshop Guide

For the actual workshop, I recommend:

1. **Introduction (5 min)**
   - Explain RAG concepts and the workshop flow
   - Set up environment variables for API keys

2. **For each section:**
   - Present the concept (theory)
   - Show the relevant code examples
   - Let participants run the code
   - Discuss the results and implications

3. **Interactive elements:**
   - For @pavlik's practice sessions, have participants modify the code (e.g., changing prompt templates, adjusting chunk sizes)
   - For document storage, compare results from different approaches

4. **Final demonstration:**
   - Run the `completeWorkshopDemo()` function to show the entire workflow
   - Discuss potential optimizations and real-world applications
